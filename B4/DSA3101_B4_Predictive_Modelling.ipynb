The park itself is quite small (I was really expecting something grand   even the main castle which was closed by the way was quite small).The food options are good, few coffee shops (including Starbucks) and plenty of gift shops. There was no issue with toilets as they are everywhere.All together it was a great day out and I really enjoyed it.</td>\n",

There is a nice walk to the disneyland parks and boardwalks. It takes around 20 mins on foot.We are revisting Disneyland paris resort in 2004, I would like to stay at this hotel, very friendly and helpful.
