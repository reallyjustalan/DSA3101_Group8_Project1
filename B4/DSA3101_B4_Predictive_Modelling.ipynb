            "Translation error: A réservé une visite de deux jours via KLook.com. Visité le 2 janvier 3. Le 2 janvier avait l'impression que l'ensemble de Hong Kong est allé visiter le complexe. De longues files d'attente partout. Moyenne de 60 minutes Temps de file d'attente pour les manèges. Parfois, atteignant 80 minutes! De longues files d'attente pour les toilettes aussi! Les toilettes féminines ont des files d'attente s'étendant jusqu'à 20 30 mètres dans certaines parties. Le spectacle de Golden Mickey a été une expérience tellement atroce. Showtime était à 18 heures, ils avaient une alimentation dès 16 h 45 et nous ont confiné à une passerelle pendant plus d'une heure. Les toilettes étaient inaccessibles si vous êtes dans la partie intérieure de la file d'attente. J'ai dû sauter par-dessus la balustrade pour aller aux toilettes avec mon enfant de 5 ans. Rien de tel que la priorité pour les personnes enceintes, les personnes handicapées et les familles avec de jeunes enfants (poussettes). Ils vous font aligner comme tout le monde et beaucoup de gens sautent dans des files d'attente. a eu une dispute avec certains clients plus d'une fois. Certains préposés au trajet étaient impolis probablement aggravés par les problèmes de langue. Un préposé à l'Orbitron Ride a été aboyant des instructions sur moi et mes enfants et moi avons eu du mal à comprendre. Probablement frustré par moi, elle a repris en retour et a dit ah bye bye!  Puis à gauche à précipitation. Ou du moins c'est ainsi qu'elle sonnait. L'affichage des feux d'artifice à 21 heures était magnifique. Mieux que Disney Anaheim pour autant que je me souvienne (nous étions à Disney Anaheim en hiver 2009). Mais après les feux d'artifice, les gens se précipitaient pour sortir et tout le monde semblait être à Main Street. Recette pour Stampede! (Par coïncidence, l'accident de bombardement de Shanghai s'est produit à peu près à la même époque). Nous avons dû nous arrêter à côté alors que les gens poussaient et poussaient. Lorsque les portes se sont ouvertes, les gens couraient vers la rue Main pour obtenir la passe. J'ai couru avec mon enfant de 8 ans et j'ai atteint le cordon de la rue principale. À 10 heures, le cordon a été ouvert et nous avons couru vers le côté gauche du château de Fantasyland où les passes étaient distribuées. J'ai vu une mère apporter une poussette pliée d'une main et la main de son jeune enfant de l'autre. Le tout-petit a trébuché et a fait traîner quelques pas. Le tout pour juste une passe pour la compétition et le salut. Nous avons pu obtenir un laissez-passer et nous avons été prévus pour une compétition et une heure de salut à 12 heures. Nous sommes allés sur place à 11h45 et nous avions été sautés deux fois dans notre file d'attente! J'ai crié mais ils m'ont juste ignoré. frustrant. La visite du 3 janvier était meilleure. Pas trop de gens, nous avons pu passer la plupart des manèges à 14 heures. C'est un petit parc après tout. Nous avons réservé un événement de restauration au personnage à l'hôtel Disneyland. Je ne le recommanderais pas. Bien que la nourriture soit bonne, mais il n'y avait que quatre caractères présents; Mickey, Minnie et deux ours que je ne me souviens pas avoir vu dans aucun des films de mes enfants. Le prix du dîner buffet était le même prix que j'ai payé pour le pass de deux jours au complexe! J'aurais pu supprimer le dîner et faire la queue dans les sites de la compétition et de saluer du parc (seuls les personnages de Frozen avaient besoin d'une passe). Nous avons été enregistrés à la porte de Novotel City et nous avons emmené le MTR à Disney. Le billet de voyage unique est HDK14 par adulte à sens unique. Changement de train à la gare de Sunny Bay et a pris le train Disney pour le complexe. En revenant à la file d'attente dans les toilettes, ma femme m'a dit que les cabines et la surface au sol des toilettes étaient bien plus petites que Disney Anaheim. J'ai également remarqué qu'il y avait beaucoup d'hommes faisant des changements de couches pour leurs enfants car la file d'attente pour les toilettes des hommes était plus courte, le cas échéant. La qualité des aliments était moyenne pour les hamburgers et les plats de poulet. Nous avons fréquenté le restaurant Tomorowland. Nous avons essayé le restaurant chinois le long de la rue Main et avons trouvé leur nourriture également moyenne mais un peu coûteuse. Les prix des souvenirs étaient moins chers que leurs homologues américains. Le personnel itinérant de Disney peut parler anglais et était très arrangeant. Les autres (en particulier certains préposés à la conduite) peuvent être impolis et ne peuvent pas parler et comprendre l'anglais. J'ai demandé à mon enfant de 8 ans sur sa préférence si jamais elle avait la chance de revenir à Disney, elle préférait le Disney à Anaheim. Mon enfant de 6 ans peut à peine se souvenir de son expérience Anaheim afin qu'il ne puisse pas le comparer avec HK. Mon enfant de 2 ans a eu le temps de sa vie pendant les moments où elle était éveillée. Dans l'ensemble, les enfants ont apprécié leur séjour à Disney HK. L'expérience de lieu de bien bien et heureuse est répandue, bien que dans des quartiers plus serrés, ou devrais-je dire dans des paquets plus petits. Je recommanderais ce parc pour sa proximité avec d'autres villes asiatiques et aussi si c'est une première fois. Est-ce que je reviendrais? Je ne peux pas mais pas de sitôt. Est-ce que je reviendrais à Hongkong juste pour Disney comme nous l'avons fait cette fois? non. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"

            "Translation error: I visited HK Disney quite a while ago (Jan 2006). I was thoroughly disappointed but not enough to write a review. However, after reading so many positive reviews, I felt compelled to write one myself.Good   Not crowded; good layout; wide streets; clean; new; cheap compared to other Disneys in every respect   food, merchandise, tickets; landscaping immaculate; convenient to get to; multiple languages for guests.Bad   SIZE; lack of attractions, especially those that make Disney so fun and have made Disney so famous in America; people cutting in lines; people spitting; people sleeping on benches and bathing in drinking fountains; staff being too timid to do anything about obvious rule breakers.Okay, I am from America and grew up near Disney World in Orlando, Florida. I worked in Guangzhou, China for quite a while including the time of HK Disney's opening. Therefore, I was constantly getting news about the new Disney. Because I grew up near Disney World, Disney's defining characteristic to me is its size. It's huge! Let me list some facts so people can understand.Disney World   30,000 acres; 4 theme parks plus many others like water parks, campgrounds, outdoor parks, etc.; 24 resort hotels not including campgrounds; 99 holes of golf available; employee training center (large office complex); huge area with employee store.HK Disney   350 acres; 1 theme park; 2 resort hotels.Disney World in Orlando is less than 1 4 developed, yet still boasts all of those things. Animal Kingdom, one park, is 500 acres, which is still larger than the entire HK Disney building area. When you enter the Disney property limits, you drive for miles without seeing anything but trees and grass. Their size of the property is astounding. The parks themselves are also huge with too many attractions to finish in one day, especially if lines are long. You can park in one place and travel from park to park by monorail. From Disney's website:  If you wanted to stay in all the guest rooms in all of the hotels and resorts currently open on Walt Disney World property (at a rate of one per night), it would take more than 61 years. HK Disney is based mostly on Magic Kingdom, one of the four theme parks in Walt Disney World. Yet, it is less than half the size of Magic Kingdom. Magic Kingdom has 45 rides. HK Disney 22, and some of those are from other parks such as Animal Kingdom. Worst of all, the rides that are most popular at Magic Kingdom are not even in HK with Space Mountain being the notable exception.For quite some time before going there, I was told HK Disney is small. I was prepared for small. I was not prepared for microscopic. It's like a miniature Magic Kingdom. The castle is 77 feet tall. WDW's is 185 feet tall, over twice as tall. Main St is tiny. When we first arrived, we unknowingly walked from one end of the park to the other not understanding why we couldn't continue (took about 5 minutes). It was only after looking at the map that we realized we had already reached the end of the park.I do not agree with some of the other members on here that construction was great. I thought many things looked quite cheap. There were also a lot of things in rides that were downscaled quite a bit compared to WDW. Overall, I felt they cut a lot of corners with the park.Space Mountain is much smaller, but might actually be better. Lion King was much different, and also possibly a better show overall.I think the worst yet best thing for me was the Mainlanders. I speak fluent Mandarin and a little Cantonese so I could understand what was going on. The worst was the Mainlanders pushing through lines as if there were no other people there. They would spit, bathe in the drinking fountains, remove shirts and shoes and lounge on benches and sidewalks, spit, stare at peole like me who are obviously foreigners and make comments, etc. They couldn't figure out how to use the Fastpass machines and caused all kinds of problems in lines everywhere. They argued when they weren't allowed to cut in front of the legitimate Fastpass holders even though they themselves had no Fastpass. The undertrained staff was too scared to enforce rules for the most part.The best was the HK residents enforcing the rules themselves. At almost every ride, while waiting, an argument would break out between a HK resident and a Mainlander because of something the latter did. It was great to watch and made waiting in line quite fun.I think Disney did a horrible job planning this park. I think Disney was not prepared for the Chinese market and customers and not at all familiar enough with them from the beginning. I think the park misrepresents Disney to those that know nothing of its other parks. There have been countless news stories of administrative problems as well. Disney built its smallest park in one of the most densely populated areas in the world next to the most populous country in the world?!?! I just find it amazing that a company as big as this could make so many mistakes. To me, it all comes down to poor planning and not knowing enough about the local market. Too bad. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"

            "Translation error: Nous avions visité Disneyland avec nos enfants en 1989 lorsque California Adventure Park était un parking, donc nous étions impatients d'explorer avec nos petits-enfants en 2019. Nous avons commencé à planifier notre voyage en juillet 2018, nous avons donc passé beaucoup de temps à rechercher les parcs et la région. Très écrasant mais tellement content que nous ayons fait la recherche. J'aurais probablement dû passer plus de temps à rechercher un parking !!! Nous avons acheté des billets de Hopper à 4 jours avec Max Pass, profitant de l'accord de résident canadien bien annoncé et en février 2019, nous avons échappé au vortex polaire en Alberta, au Canada et nous sommes dirigés vers LAX. Le temps était plus frais que prévu, mais notre location de maison et la piscine extérieure chauffée et le bain à remous nous ont toujours réchauffés et un manteau de pluie ou un poncho était emballé. J'avais également roulé ma veste de paquet et l'avais mise dans mon sac à dos. Excellente idée. Les parcs sont écrasants et vous avez vraiment besoin d'une sorte de plan le premier jour où vous arrivez. Pour nous, les matins étaient trop cool pour utiliser notre entrée tôt le matin que nous avons payé, donc nous sommes souvent arrivés vers 10h00. (Après avoir pris une baignade matinale et un bon petit déjeuner). Malheureusement, l'activité Disney n'a pas mis à niveau dans son système de sécurité qui est très archaïque et chaotique. Un peu semble être un projet de travail? L'expérience de sécurité a été un début très frustrant pour ce qui est devenu de bons jours. Oui, le parc est cher mais presque tous les visiteurs portent une sorte d'équipement Disney. Nous espérions que février serait un mois moins que chargé à visiter, mais rétrospectivement, il choisirait la météo plutôt que la foule la prochaine fois. Je ne peux pas imaginer la saison chargée !! Les restaurants avaient toujours des temps d'attente de 30 à 45 minutes, donc si vous prévoyez de manger dans le parc, vous planifiez votre temps de siège autour d'un trajet ou d'une boutique de cadeaux serrés. Nous avons mangé dans quelques restaurants assis sur place et le service était toujours sympathique et génial. La nourriture était correcte mais la facture était toujours grande et les dollars américains si grand pour nous. Peut-être que les prix sont quelque peu gonflés pour compenser les boissons non alcoolisées vendues dans la politique du parc? Nos petits-enfants ont des âges de 6 et 8 ans et leurs hauteurs leur ont permis de vivre toutes les manèges. L'enfant en eux aimait Mickey's Toontown mais pas le manoir hanté ou les bobslets de Matterhorn qui étaient un peu effrayants pour eux, mais Indiana Jones, Thunder Mountain Railroad et Splash Mountain étaient de grands succès !!! Soyez prêt à vous mouiller sur Splash Mountain. Ils vendent des serviettes à la sortie de la balade. Nous les avons bien sûr emmenés dans des endroits dont nous nous souvenons de 1989 comme Pirates des Caraïbes, la croisière dans la jungle et la salle Tiki enchantée. (Hits également). Qui n'aime pas une course tranquille à travers son petit monde. Les défilés tout au long de la journée ont été agréables et à voir au moins une fois. Le spectacle de lumière et de feux d'artifice de 9h30 restera dans les mémoires. Nous avons attrapé un souper tardif au Cafe en carnation notre première soirée et c'était le cadre parfait pour le feu d'artifice. Lors de notre deuxième visite à Disney, nous nous sommes garés dans le parking Simba et après avoir défrigé la sécurité, nous avons sauté sur le monorail qui nous a emmenés directement à Tomorrowland. Entrée du parc la plus fluide que nous avions. Le premier jour, nous avons commenté le peu de personnages Disney que nous avons vus. Ils ne semblaient que dans le défilé, mais lors de notre deuxième visite, nous en avons vu. Malheureusement, les lignes pour les photos étaient toujours longues et assez souvent, il semblait que ce serait presque votre tour et le personnage se dirigeait vers un nouvel emplacement. Oups une autre occasion manquée. Peut-être que si les enfants avaient eu le premier bouton de visite que nous avons vu à quelques reprises, ils ont peut-être reçu une opportunité unique. Pluton se trouvait juste à la porte arrière du magasin de caméras à Toontown lors d'une visite. Instantané. J'ai compris!! Soyez prêt à marcher pendant des heures, à prendre une churrio chaude ou un bretzel, à faire des folies sur un gâteau en entonnoir (nous en avons partagé un) et peut-être prendre un fouet Dole? Les enfants avaient chacun leur propre argent à dépenser dans les boutiques de cadeaux, ce qui était une excellente idée car ils avaient peut-être tout voulu s'ils dépensaient l'argent d'autre mais étaient très fiers de leur expérience de magasinage. Le centre-ville de Disney est en fait juste à l'extérieur des deux entrées du parc, mais à l'intérieur de la zone de sécurité. Il est rempli de magasins, de restaurants et de divertissements. Il est accessible sans billet d'entrée de parc, il est donc occupé non seulement avec les amateurs de parc mais qui se soucie de visiter le centre-ville de Disney. Super occupé et presque impossible pour obtenir une réservation dans l'un des restaurants. La grâce salvatrice de la fin de notre journée et comme nous avons quitté le parc était un café chaud de Starbucks !!! J'ai journalisé notre visite du Parking et je l'ai lue aux enfants l'autre jour. Ils sourient toujours !!! --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"

            "Translation error: We decided to take our full family on a trip to Disney (mom, dad, adult daughter and her spouse, 19 y.o. & 16 y.o. & 2 dogs!)Best thing about our trip was the kennel at Disneyland. Clean, staff was friendly, and very affordable!All except one of our family has been to Disneyland & California Adventures. We purchased the trip through Costco Travel so I can   t complain one bit about the ticket price and hotel cost. 16 year old is a Type 1 Diabetic and last trip they accommodated this illness splendidly. This go round was an overall disappointment, went to City Hall to see about accommodations and the female staff was polite but more or less said too bad but enjoy your visit with your diabetic. Didn   t expect special treatment but without any accommodations made it difficult to maintain good blood sugar levels when the entire day is spent standing in long lines. We were told that the rest of our party could save a place in line for her if she needed to attend to her symptoms. Get real Disney staff! While we did use Fastpass options our first day (Monday May 14) we were able to get onto 6 popular rides only and were onsite for over 10 hours! Spouse had a brain tumor removed about 45 days prior. His right leg was still weak from the procedure so we finally ended up renting a wheelchair to ease his discomfort. I appreciated the ability to get a return time for a ride and had few problems with this accommodation. Different story when you use a Fastpass and the wheelchair entrance. While staff was overall friendly about it you do get pushed to the side and placed on hold until they deem fit to grant you access. Would have been faster to use the Fastpass    normally   . Didn   t stress about it with the return time procedure as you typically were told to return prior to the standby wait time. Last time here we commented on how clean the parks were, still the same but I am seeing some of the rides and attractions are showing wear and tear and fading paint colors. Also noticed that staff were somewhat disgruntled whether this is from poor wages, hours, or constant torture from errant children and inattentive parents it placed a sour note for all of my family. Let   s talk about strollers, stroller parking areas, stroller drivers, stroller right of ways. Think there might be a new Disneyland area called    Stroller Sarcophagus   . Heaven forbid you try to walk through an area that is deemed a walkway because stroller parking lot is the new norm. Attempting this with someone in a wheelchair is not for the faint of heart! Forget about being injured on an attraction, walking to them was where we all received bumps, scratches, and bruises as souvenirs for the day. Sad to say that the Pirates ride was closed for refurbishment during our visit. There wasn   t as many characters to visit with as in past trips either. Thank heavens we did get to take a picture with Captain Jack though! Didn   t use the Photo pass option so you were told to quickly move along. Maybe because my kids are older but Disneyland was not as enjoyable as in past visits. The parks seemed so much more commercially centered then when it was about Walt   s original vision. Sad. Especially for the cost of admission. One member of our party   s pass stopped working at the Fastpass kiosk. Was told to go to City Hall for replacement. Regardless of it being our final day in the park the staff issued a paper ticket and then kept the    souvenir    pass. When it was asked to be returned as a keepsake was told that they couldn   t do that. We asked for a supervisor and were told that there wasn   t one available as they are all supervisors in City Hall. When questioned further about this the staffer then became flustered being caught in a lie so she said there was nothing further she or anyone could do for us. As the other 5 members of our group already had a Fastpass for the ride could we get another one for this member. She flat out said it wasn   t possible. Frustrating to say the least. California Adventures day was better but with the rollercoaster and Ferris wheel being closed for refurbishment there really wasn   t a lot of options for us as we didn   t have little kids to placate or need to join the stroller brigade. California Adventures was dwindled down to lots of eating options, expensive alcohol, and roughly 5 attractions to hold our interest unless we paid to shop all day. Highlight of our day here was the parade attendant who put on the best comedy and dance routine while directing pedestrian traffic before the parade. Last thing to note: be prepared to be pushed out of the parks after the parade or fireworks. There is no way to get to a different    land    other than the gates with the way you   re driven like cattle and jockeying for position between the stroller brigades. The fireworks display is great but would it be too much to ask if you closed the umbrellas for more people to be able to view the images on the castle??? Will we be back? Yes but better prepared with strategies to get around the park, platinum admission cards, and shin guards for nefarious strollers drivers and passengers!

            "Translation error: Cette revue est ce que j'ai appris à faire et à ne pas faire. Par où commencer!?! Ok, laissez-vous commencer avant. Avant d'aller au parc, je lis le blog après le blog sur How to Conquier the Park. Ne fais pas ça !! Quand nous y sommes arrivés, j'étais déjà sur le bord. Prêt à courir comme un poulet avec ma tête coupée pour tirer le meilleur parti du parc. Quand nous sommes arrivés et j'ai vu d'autres adultes courir vers des lignes ouvrir pour entrer et traîner leurs enfants ici et là. Les parents qui se repentent pour que leur enfant puisse vivre des choses. Les parents hurlent sur leurs enfants parce qu'ils ont dépensé tout cet argent, alors ils vont forcer leurs enfants à faire des trajets même si l'enfant pleurait et disait qu'ils avaient peur. M'a brisé le cœur !! J'ai aperçu à quoi j'allais ressembler et je me suis arrêté là et j'ai complètement changé mon plan !! J'ai réalisé que Disney est censé être sur ce que vos enfants veulent faire. Ça ne va nulle part et c'est à propos de vos enfants !! ENFANTS!! Faites vos enfants !! Je me suis donc tourné vers mon enfant de 8 et 4 ans et leur ai demandé ce qu'ils voulaient faire. Après avoir fait ça ... c'était une période incroyable et relaxante. Je leur ai dit que nous pouvons revenir si nous n'avons pas tout frappé. Cela a fonctionné. Ils étaient détendus et mon mari et moi aussi. J'ai enseigné à mes enfants et à moi-même une leçon de vie et de parent. SE DÉTENDRE!! Tout ce qu'ils voulaient faire, c'était d'obtenir des autographes de personnages et de faire des promenades au fur et à mesure que nous les voyons. Donc, dans toute ma préparation, j'ai téléchargé l'application. Faites ça !! Cela en vaut la peine. Achetez le Pass Max. Vaut le billet de 10 $. Dans l'application, vous pouvez utiliser le Pass max. Tous les trajets ne sont pas là-bas et ils manquent de passes pour les manèges, donc si vous voulez vraiment faire un tour, je le ferai. Aucun trajet dans Fantasyland n'a pas de passes rapides ou de passer maximum de ce que j'ai vu. Il y en avait dans la ville de Toon. Faire une passe rapide ou maximale en vaut la peine. L'application contient également vos billets JIC Vous perdez vos billets en papier. Il a également une carte du parc et tous les personnages. Où ils sont. Quand. Quelle heure. Combien de temps. Combien de temps les attentes du trajet sont. TOILETTES. Photopass, qui en vaut la peine. Il est livré avec MaxPass. Il vous permet d'enregistrer vos photos sur votre téléphone. Assurez-vous de scanner votre code avant ou après que vos photos soient prises par les photographes. L'application vous permet également de réserver et de voir le temps manger dans les restaurants locaux. Ok donc nous sommes allés lundi et c'était encore relativement bondé. Parking préféré. Cela en vaut la peine. Nous étions si près de l'escalator après 14 heures dans le parc, c'était merveilleux de voir notre voiture juste là en haut des escaliers. Apportez votre propre nourriture et votre propre eau ou des collations. Je dirais que nous avons facilement dépensé 500 $ uniquement pour la nourriture et les boissons seuls, alors la prochaine fois que nous parvrons, j'apporte notre nourriture. Aussi rien n'a de recharge. De plus, c'est plus sain et je ne pense pas qu'il n'y ait rien de moins de 5 $. Oh je suis désolé, une petite chose de pop-corn était 4,75 $ !! Les enfants ybmy mangent comme des adolescents et mon mari le fait trop lol, donc ça nous sauvera un joli sou la prochaine fois. De plus, je pensais que c'était ridicule que le déjeuner dans l'un des restaurants là-bas pour une fête de 4 était de près de 60 $. Tout ce que nous avions, c'était la salade de poulet, le combo de hamburgers et 2 repas pour enfants. Je me sentais gypped quand j'ai vu tous les vétérinaires avec leurs chariots et déjeuners emballés. Aucun des blogs n'a dit que lol ... nous avons fait le personnage à manger mais c'est une critique différente. Ils ont des souvenirs que vous pouvez acheter, mais j'ai sauvé ces choses jusqu'à ce que nous soyons sur le point de quitter le parc parce que 1. Je ne veux pas le transporter toute la journée. 2. Vous pouvez trouver à peu près tout dans le magasin Disney au centre-ville de Disney. Du moins pour vos enfants. Pour toi. Peut être. Les manèges avaient de longues lignes et le temps d'attente, alors soyez préparé à cela. Essayez d'utiliser le passage rapide si vous le pouvez. Nous avons essayé de faire une terre à la fois, nous ne courions donc pas partout dans le parc. Cela dit, dans les 14 heures passées là-bas, nous ne frappons que Fantasyland, Adventureland, Tomorrowland, New Orleans Square et Critter Country. Nous avons monté le train à la toute fin et la plupart des gens sont partis après les feux d'artifice, nous avons donc fait un tour après cela. Indiana Jone car il était si proche de la sortie. Détendez-vous dans l'ensemble et passez un bon moment. Nous l'avons fait. Je recommande fortement de faire plusieurs voyages afin que vous puissiez vraiment profiter de chaque terrain. Nous reviendrons plus préparés et nous sommes impatients de voir les choses auxquelles nous ne sommes pas arrivés. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"

            "Translation error: My husband and I brought our 3 year old son to Disneyland for a family vacation. We would do anything for him, and at the end of the day(s) I think he enjoyed himself and that is really what matters.That said, what a nightmare this experience turned out to be. Happiest place on Earth? More like Hell on Earth. I   m not sure where to begin. The night before we planned to go, we tried to purchase tickets on the app, but received error messages. We ended up calling some customer service number, and purchasing over the phone. We were told to pick up the tickets at will call. When we got to the park we somehow ended up in the line to actually enter the park, even though we were directed to that line as the    pick up ticket    line. When we realized this, my husband jumped out of line to go find the actual ticket booth. At this point, we   d already been waiting in line for quite a while. I tried to find some shade for my son and I to wait in. I guess we were in the way, and an employee actually asked if she needed to call security. When we finally got tickets, we went to the back of the entrance line. Again. Ok. Whatever. Possibly our mistake for being clueless newbies, even though we were directed to that line.Once we were about to enter, the man who took our tickets also needed to take our picture?? I was not aware pictures were taken, or for what purpose. So I wasn   t really prepared. He practically barked at me to remove my sunglasses. He followed this up by yelling at me that I was in the wrong line for the turnstile the stroller would fit through. Wow. Glad I was wearing my first time to Disneyland pin!Speaking of strollers, these were perhaps some of the crappiest strollers I   ve ever seen with very limited room for storing any items. Small, uncomfortable, dirty. This is Disney, I mean it   s supposed to be family friendly. In my humble opinion, they can do better.Once we were in the park, it really wasn   t much better of a scene. It was crazy crowded. People were bumping into us and the stroller. And I was fearful of hitting people with our stroller. I think I finally understand    packed in like sardines   . The waits for the preschool rides were 30 45 minutes (followed by like 3 minutes of actual ride time), which doesn   t exactly scream kid friendly to me. Thank goodness I was prepared with distractions and ice water. (Ironically, we ran into a    cast member    later, who told us it was a slow day and to imagine ten times more people and waits of 4 8 hours. Ummmmmm where is the magic in that experience?!) Speaking of    cast members   , I could not believe how unhappy so many of the employees looked. If we spoke to a dozen employees over our two day visit, I can think of two that were    bubbly   . The rest apeared tired, grumpy, and uneager to assist. I actually felt guilty for asking the few newbie questions I asked. In addition to this, I heard    cast members    grumbling about    not being scheduled for break   . We encountered more employees (you could tell from the name badges), that we didn   t interact with, and so many just looked ridiculously unhappy. By this point, I couldn   t wait to meet the characters who I was certain would bring the magic. And this brings me to perhaps the most disappointing part of the whole experience. For months we told our son about how he would get to meet the characters. We really played it up. I mean he   s three, so meeting the characters was bound to be the highlight of the trip for him. Over two days, we saw Belle from afar, the evil queen from Snow White from afar and Pluto. Pluto shook my little guy   s hand but was gone before we could get a picture or an autograph. Thank goodness I had booked a character breakfast (for which we were seated 35 minutes after our reserved time) where we    met    Mickey, Minnie, Daisy and Stitch. If I had not, we would have only    met    Pluto. Whoop dee do. My little guy was so disappointed and kept asking where the characters were. At one point I mentioned something to the guy trying to sell us a vacation club membership, and he said there should be two characters    right over there   , but when he went to point, he was like    oh, they   re not there now   . Helpful. He ended up giving us a sticker. A for effort?I knew that our trip would be expensive, and that there would be crowds, and lines. But I honestly expected so much more for the ridiculous amount of money spent, and to be honest, from the name Disney. I guess we simply missed the magic that calls some people back for multiple visits. Before investing your money, and time, in a trip to Disneyland, do your research. I didn   t write this review only to rant. I   m not sure reading a review like this one would have deterred me from a visit, because I visited for the Kiddo, not myself. But after day two, I left feeling only like I   d completed a parenting rite of passage, like I checked something off of a lifelong to do list. I felt no magic, no wonder, no awe. Perhaps just some sadness mixed with disappointment. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"

            "Translation error: Our family travels to Disney parks 2 3 times a year if not more and as a family of 5 this is not an affordable trip however we love Disney so much the expense is worth it! We usually go to Disney World however decided to take a quick trip to Disneyland this year. We purchased 3 day one park tickets for our family. We went to Disneyland park 2 days and California Adventure for one day. Before leaving we find out many rides were shut down as well as part of Main Street, which we had no choice at this point as flights were booked and time had been taken from work. The first day, February 21, we went to Disneyland park we tried to find the days that we could use our magic morning and the employees in the ticket booth were helpful in finding the days but in no way made the experience magical. Usually at park opening the train comes around with characters on it and a family to open the park and on this day the train arrived with no characters and they did a park opening with a family on the ground in front of park gates that no one could see and it wasn   t very enthusiastic. The process of getting into the park was tedious scan your ticket, take a photo (so your ticket cannot be used by anyone else) and sign your ticket, the gate employees are rather rude and just want to get you in and gone. Walking into the park our kids were excited so we headed toward the rides. The ride lines were longer than usual which may be because so many rides were closed at once. There was a strange incident while we were in line for the gadget coaster in Toontown. The ride was stopped and an announcement was made as if the ride had a maintenance issue. But come to find out there was a man that had a selfie stick and was trying to use it on the ride. We waited about 15 minutes until security got there to remove him and proceed to argue with him at the ride exit. We asked about fireworks and were told by an employee that fireworks were only on the weekends and depended on weather. We purchased some items at the store outside of Space Mountain and the employees were helpful and answered questions and helped us find the sizes we were looking for. There were no parades due to construction on Main Street and no fireworks on this day so we ended up leaving the park earlier than we normally would. Day 2 at Disneyland was what really made this trip awful! On day 2 my brother and his family joined us. My niece is autistic and gets sever anxiety when standing in long unending lines so my sister in law called ahead to make sure she would be able to get an ADA pass for the lines and she was told she could. We waited in line at Town Hall for what seemed like an hour. They finally got in and requested the pass and my sister in law was made to feel like she was lying. They asked a million questions about her disability etc. If it   s the case that someone needs to prove an actual disability, why wasn   t she told over the phone to bring some type of proof with her? However we saw many able bodied people cruising up the exit line with their wheelchairs, were the given the same treatment. Your employees really need some training about autism and how if effects each person differently. We proceeded to the rides after the 20 questions and tried to have a good day. This pass my niece was given was an awful waste of time. She had to go to a specific stand (2 in the entire park) to get one fast pass which many times it seemed the fast pass lines were longer than the regular lines. But hey if we would have spent an $90 a day we could have pre booked our fast passes(a service that is Free at Disneyworld). We ate lunch in Cafe Orleans and it was great. The waitstaff was quick to clear our plates and have friendly conversation with us. Wish all the Disneyland employees were so great! We rode a few more rides and part of our group left for a nap. Later that evening we headed to the queue for Fantasmic, we were pointed to the viewing area for people we did not get fast passes and at the entrance of this queue we asked were stroller parking was and we were told to take it with us. We were walking in dim lighting mind you and looking for a spot with a grumpy tired 3 year old jumping out of his stroller. We were distracted I will say but how many parents at Disneyland go thru the same thing every single day. While we were walking not focused on the ground which I guess we were expected to be, Shania stepped in front of my stroller and said rudely this area is for fast pass only do you have a fastpass? We told her no that someone pointed us down here for queueing of people who did not have fast passes. She told us see this line (a line of green tape on the ground that is not really noticeable) you need to stay on that side. So we found seats and sat down. Unfortunately we were near to ride Shania and another employee who talked the whole time we were waiting. We heard all about her snap chat, listened to her sing about being mixed (I   m also mixed along with my kids so this is in no way related to that), listened to her playing and joking all the while being rude to everyone that didn   t see her line. Then she felt the need to approach us again after sitting in the same spot for 20 minutes to tell us we needed to move our stroller to the back. We loved the stroller and finally the show started. The show was great and we left. The experience we had during this Disneyland trip was so awful we don   t want to return ever. I guess our family got used to the great service at Disneyworld we   re employees are nice and friendly at all times, we never see them on their phones and when they are standing around queuing people they don   t talk about irrelevant things they try to keep that Disney experience away from the outside world. The unfortunate thing is despite all the negative reviews Disneyland is getting is that nothing will change and it will continue to nosedive because the hundred of families that are having awful experiences won   t change ticket sales so they won   t change anything and will continue to raise prices and families will pay to get to experience the theory of Disneyland. I wrote this review in hopes that if people keep pointing out the awful experiences they are having then maybe these kids you are hiring will get some customer service skills instead of continuing to think that they can treat people however they choose because even if that family or person doesn   t return others will. Get it together Disneyland for the millions of other families that are going to waste their money, time and family vacation time on coming there! --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"

            "Translation error: Je sais que Disneyland s'appelle l'endroit le plus heureux du monde, mais j'ai été très déçu lors de ma récente visite. Ma petite-fille de 4 ans et sa mère, ma autre fille et moi-même ont tous planifié une première visite surprise à Disney pour ma petite-fille ... Nous avons acheté un laissez-passer d'une journée alors que ma fille et ma petite-fille ont volé de l'État de Washington pendant seulement quelques jours. Nous avons anticipé une journée fantastique, et nous l'avons apprécié, car mes 4 ans ont été excités et aimaient les Rides, avec un favori, car mes 4 ans ont été excités et aimaient les Rides, avec un favori, car mes 4 ans avaient été excités et aimons les Rides, avec un favori, car mes 4 ans avaient été excités et aimaient les Rides, avec un favori, car mes 4 ans ont été excités et aimaient les Rides, avec un favori. Nous étions arrivés tôt pour profiter au maximum de la journée, de 10 h à 22 h ... puis vers 20 h 30, nous avons décidé de monter Peter Pan, l'attraction pour enfants la plus populaire de Fantasyland, qui plus tôt dans la journée, la ligne était trop longue, même à 20 h 30, nous avons encore dû attendre patiemment pendant 30 minutes! Pour s'adapter et se lever avec son dos à la barre de métaux lourds qui est poussé vers le bas pour vous sécuriser dans le trajet, puis la fille manipulant la balade nous a dit de plaire à s'asseoir et a repoussé la barre sur mes grandes filles à plusieurs reprises. J'étais consterné et je lui ai dit que nous ne rentrions pas tous, le gestionnaire Gracie a continué à insister, je lui ai demandé si nous pouvions sortir et sauter dans la prochaine voiture? Elle a insisté pour que nous fassions des trucs à l'intérieur. Elle était extrêmement grossière avec nous tous et de pousser une barre en métal sur mes grandes filles n'était pas nécessaire ... Gracie a ensuite dit quelque chose de grossier à mes 2 filles, a roulé des yeux et après notre sortie, elle les a envoyés dans la balade, a dit à ma petite fille et je me recula derrière la ligne jaune et puis je pourrais croire ce que je pourrais croire à la main dans le panneau de commande et m'arrêtais toute la balade, et j'ai pris l'allumage ... Je pourrais vraiment croire à la main dans le panneau de commande et m'arrêtait, et j'ai pris l'allumage ... Je pourrais vraiment croire à la main dans le panneau de commande et m'arrêtait, et j'ai pris l'allumage ... Je pourrais vraiment croire à la main dans le panneau de commande et m'arrêtait, et je me suis efforcé de croire que je ne pouvais pas croire à la main dans le panneau de commande. Puis une autre jeune femme est venue gérer les commandes et je lui ai demandé le nom de la fille qui a pris d'assaut, elle a dit qu'elle ne savait pas et qu'elle était nouvelle à Disney et la balade elle-même. Quelques instants plus tard, un jeune homme est entré et plusieurs autres employés et ils ont parlé de la façon de faire fonctionner le trajet. Ce jeune homme s'est avéré Javier, le directeur de la balade. Nous étions déroutés pour expliquer pourquoi le trajet ne se déroulait pas, mes filles m'ont appelé depuis à l'intérieur du trajet et ont dit que les lumières sont venues à l'intérieur de la balade avec un autre couple devant nous, je me demandant ce qui s'était passé, au moins 20 minutes plus tard, le trajet a recommencé, jamais des excuses pour nous devoir attendre, alors mes 2 filles à l'intérieur ont dû faire des lumières et avoir pu finir à la fin de la fin de la fin de la fin de la fin de la fin de la fin de la balle et de la conduite, mais ils ont dû faire des lumières et avoir pu fini la fin de la balle et se demander si elles pouvaient rouler avec tous les lumières et ont été de fin Off.Gracie, la fille grossière était maintenant à la fin de la balade et a lancé sa main, a roulé des yeux et a dit quelque chose de grossier à mes filles. La crèche Javier a été informée de ce qui s'était passé et de la façon dont nous étions tous harcelés, et a dit que ce n'était pas du harcèlement, et il l'a repoussé. À cette fois, on nous a dit de reprendre le trajet, de ma petite-fille et de moi-même et de traverser, j'ai été dégoûté par le traitement et le manque de là, et je n'ai jamais offert une autre explication. Après avoir rencontré mes 2 filles à la fin de la ville, et nous avons trouvé un autre Pierre-Pansrection Hall, et demandez un plaid pour déposer une plainte. Elle était la seule employée de Ride qui a offert des excuses pour ce qui venait de se passer ... et a dit que tous les employés de Disney ne sont pas si gentils ... Nous étions extrêmement bouleversés et avons décidé d'aller prendre le train pour la ville à l'entrée car nous étions tous épuisés, nous sommes finalement arrivés et nous avons dû attendre dans une longue ligne pour déposer une plainte. C'était maintenant 10: PM la nuit et nous avons été si fatigués, nous avons attendu dans la plainte des clients pendant 30 minutes. Et entrez à l'intérieur et la jeune femme a entendu notre plaidoyer, et a été tellement scénarisée dans sa réponse, disant à quel point elle était désolée, tout cela s'est produit et que ce n'était pas une bonne expérience, puis elle nous a offert des passes rapides `` Le parc, et aucune autre compensation, et nous nous proposons, car il était 10 h 30 le soir, et le parc fermé en 30 minutes ... et ils nous offraient des laissez-passer rapides, je l'ai fait dire que les employés ont été rédigés et par téléphone à un concours téléphonique à un soutien de disse C'était tout ... ils ne pouvaient pas offrir de compensation supplémentaire. Je pense que Disney pourrait au Mimimum nous offrir des billets de retour pour vivre un autre jour pour racheter la mauvaise expérience ou nous offrir notre argent, à tout le moins, car le harcèlement que nous avons reçu était très inutile et un enfant de 4 ans devrait ne jamais se souvenir de la barre de métal qui a fait une expérience similaire? S'il vous plaît laissez-moi savoir . --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"

            "Translation error: Hahaha, title says it all. Ridiculous prices, but do you get what you pay for? Eh, maybe yes, maybe no. I went alone so I could do what I wanted to do. This is the first time I've actually paid to go because usually I get free tickets by winning them or knowing people who work there who need to use their extra tickets, and go with family. Prices are ridiculous, but I knew that before going. This is technically a review for both Disney parks. Cons1) Ticket lines are sooooooooooo slow. There were only a couple of people ahead of me and it took forever for my turn. Then I went up, told the lady exactly what I wanted, had my cash out, and it still took her forever. A snail could have done it faster.2) Walking in the gate with the ticket you just bought is just as slow and painful. They take pictures of you now so if you buy a multi day ticket you can't sell it off to someone else (fine, whatever, I get it) but it just makes the lines horrendously long and slow just to get in. The people behind me complained,  They should have a line for season passholders.  I don't have a season pass, obviously, but he's right. Why make them wait through the photo sessions?3) No real discounts for SoCal residents. If you want a one day pass you don't really get a discount. Discounts maybe for two or three days, but I don't need two or three days, and quite frankly if I used that I'd have to drive home and back and one drive up to Anaheim every few months in the crummy CA traffic is more than enough. If I stayed in Anaheim then I'd have to pay extra for a hotel, so there really wouldn't be savings.4) Soooooooooo many people. They should cut off the number somewhere, but obviously they won't because of $$$$$$$$$. Oh, and this wasn't considered a  Peak Day . I'd hate to see how many people are there on those days. 5) Single Ply Toilet Paper? That seriously wasn't a joke. Why do you pay so much for tickets and then use the restrooms to find out they only buy single ply toilet paper? Cheapskates. (Yeah, I can't believe I even had that thought, but I did.)6) Disney is great at line deception. You see the time, then look at the line and think,  Oh, that's not so bad.  Then you get in line and it just goes back and forth and back and forth and around and down and up and in places you didn't even know existed getting into the line..... Yikes. It's amazing how well they can hide a line of a gazillion people.7) Dirty. Dirty. Dirty. Usually Disney is pretty clean, but this time it was just gross. Food all over the ground. Almost squished my feet in several discarded food items including popcorn, ice cream sandwiches, and who knows what else. And there were random things lying around in ride lines *cough cough* tampon *cough cough*. EW. 8) People start lining up for the parade like two hours early and then there are just people in the way. Everywhere. Oh, and for those of use pathetic souls there by ourselves, who might want to go on rides that normally have lines out the wazoo with parents and little kids in Fantasyland.... Parade time might be a good time to do that except, oh yeah, they shut everything down in Fantasyland at that time. Now I'm not sure of the real reasoning behind this because at this point, I left and went to Downtown Disney until after the parade and fireworks crowd cleared out, but yeah, that sucks. I can't for the life of me figure out why the ride for the Peter Pan ride is so massively long, even when I've gone to  night parties  with radio stations. Fourth or fifth time here and FINALLY got on it   with a  Short  time of 30 mins, and this was at 11:00pm. 9) People are rude as can be. Cutting in line, trying to ram you with their stroller if you aren't moving fast enough (trust me, I move as fast as possible, but can't do that if there are a million people in the way). Just randomly stop in the middle of walkways to check their phone or map. 10) Disney used to have lines down to a science. What happened? Fast pass lines longer than the regular line. People seemed to be having trouble having their phones scan using that option for their fast passes, so that slowed things down. Employees urging people to get fast passes for that CURRENT TIME so the people already in line have to wait longer (why??). Single rider line over on Screamin' is a joke (Universal does this very well, Disney does NOT. Maybe it's done poorly on purpose?) 11) There are issues with the lines in the restaurants. The main one I went to was Rockett's whatever over in Tomorrowland. Choices of Salad, Pasta, or Pizza. The employee flat out said Salad and Pasta were one line, Pizza was separate. Then he disappeared, so while the rest of us waited for pasta in a non moving salad line, people were cutting ahead of us and getting grumpy behind us. Food didn't appear to be coming out, and the line was at a stand still. 12) Parking. Due to the number of people you park all the way out in the Timbuktu Lot, and then you get the fun of waiting in a long line (for the shuttles)   before you even get to the parks!13) Star WarsPros1) Long Hours. The day I went the hours at DL were 8am to 12am (till 10pm at CA). I had hoped to get there earlier, but to avoid the worst of the traffic on the expressways, I didn't leave until about 8:30am and got there by about 10:15am. This actually worked out better for me. I ended up staying there later that evening and I got in a good number of rides AFTER the fireworks crowd left. If I had gotten there earlier, I probably would have left the parks earlier and not come back. 2) Due to the close Proximity of the parks, I was able to go to DL, do a bunch of stuff, head over to CA and do many things I wanted to do, then head back to DL and get in some more fun. I was also able to  escape  for a bit and grab dinner at Downtown Disney, then head back yet again. 3) Was happy with what I managed to fit into my day. I fit in my favorites. Did a bunch of extras. Saw some of those street shows. Got to both parks. And this was with a million people there. If you're able to use the Fast Passes properly (I only used one all day, by the way   and didn't pay extra for whatever the cell phone thing is, since I don't have a cell phone) and pay attention to the slow areas you'll get in quite a bit. If you go on an off day you can probably squeeze a lot more into a one day ticket. 4) Employees   All were nice and super helpful, no matter how stupid my question. Hey, it's Disney!5) Free Water   Managed to get through the day buying only one drink. With my meals and even the ice cream I had, I just got a nice cup of ice water. At the right places they'll give you nice big cups too, rather than those dinky little things, to stay cool and hydrated! And trust me, on a mid summer day in SoCal, you'll appreciate it.6) First Aid area was a lifesaver. I had a massive headache I had been battling all day and despite drinking tons of water and doing everything I knew how to get rid of it without taking anything, I finally decided to get something so I could fully enjoy the rest of the day. I thought it might take awhile but I simply asked if they had anything, wrote down my name, and they handed me a two pack of some sort of headache relieving awesomeness. Easy peasy. Overall it was a decent day, but I think I'll stick with my original belief that it's only best to go to places like this in the off season. It was good for the day it was, but could have been a lot less stressful and lot more enjoyable when it's not as packed. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"

            "Translation error: There are 21,000  reviews of the  Happiest Place on Earth , so I guess that I'll try to keep this one centered around our specific experience to help those folks attempting a similar trip. My wife and I stayed several blocks south of the park with our two children (girl   3 yo, boy   5 yo) and intended to do a 3 day single park pass to Disneyland. And we intended to get our money's worth, so if you   re go getters, this is the review for you.I   ll break the review up by topic: Getting Around, Rides, Events, Characters, Food, and Important Notes at the end.Getting Around:We arrived early on Saturday, dropped our gear at the hotel, and walked the several blocks to Downtown Disney, the shopping plaza between the two parks. We did this mostly to get a reconnaissance of where the entry gates were, and to get familiar with the distance to the park and travel time. Downtown Disney has a fun feel to it, but as my son said, very disappointed, on the walk back to the hotel,  That was Disneyland? . This was the second reason we went, to see how the kids reacted to the crowd, followed directions, and handled that much Mickey Mouse. No son, that was the appetizer.Bring rent a stroller. I can   t emphasize this enough. My wife and I went back and forth on this. I was worried about maneuvering, leaving the stroller behind, packing it, etc. I finally gave in to my wife's (better) judgement and boy am I glad we did. Our youngest could have walked, but would have slowed us down considerably. The stroller sped her up, worked as additional storage, and stroller parking is as easy as dumping your stroller on any unoccupied wall. If we could have done a standup kickboard on the back, that would have been ideal, as in addition to transporting the kids, it was nice to keep them close and under control as the crowd can easily sweep away kids. I was worried about thieves, but apparently, the only concern for strollers was if the Disney  stroller attendants  consolidate your stroller further away than where you left it. An identifying marker on your stroller is a great idea. To the family with the flashing LED rope, you shame us all with your ingenuity. Seeing as we only had one stroller and that we would be making the four times daily (coming back for naps) we decided to get an ART (Anaheim Resort Transit) 3 day pass. For the entire family, it was $34. Score. The bus picked up at the convention center near our hotel, you could text for bus arrival times, and it was a straight shot to the park. Easy peasy. That being said, there were some negatives. Make sure to inquire as to any delays (accidents, construction, marathons, etc.). On the day of our magic morning, there was construction, which took us a roundabout way, to sit 15 minutes at a broken light. Long story short, our extra hour was cut significantly short. I would highly recommend communicating with transit ahead of time where timeliness is important.Getting into the Downtown Disney and Park Entrance areas, there are several security lines. Have your bag ready for a quick scan and be ready for some long lines. Security moves far faster than the ticket entry lines, so be sure to come at least 30 minutes early if you   re hoping to get in when the park opens. There are ticket vendors here as well, but do the smart thing and buy your tickets in advance. See the Disney App note below. You   ll have plenty of time to wait in lines so why practice here. Rides:We charged into the park to do battle with the masses in pursuit of nostalgia and sunburns! Our plan was to conquer Fantasyland and Toon Town first. For those of you that might not be familiar with your DL geography, Fantasyland is where all of the acid trip rides from the beginning are kept: Toad's Wild Ride, Sleeping Beauty, Pinocchio, etc. These rides can be a little intense as they're very dark, very jerky, chances are your kids haven't seen the movies, and they're extremely loud, flashy, and a tad creepy. We did all of these once just to cross them off the list and move on. Toon Town has all of the character houses as well as a couple smaller rides and shops. The most critical piece for us here was Gadget's Go Coaster. That's everyone's favorite female mouse from Chip and Dale's Rescue Rangers. It's so important because our children had not been initiated into the world of roller coasters as of yet, and this one is approximately 10 seconds long, all open air, and over before your kid knows that it started. This was a good barometer for us to gauge how the kids would do with the rest of the rides. Spoiler; they loved it. I won't review each of the rides individually, but I'll give you some rankings that I think are important as far as the kids are concerned. Scaredy Cat Level: Storybook Land Canal, King Arthur's Carousel, Casey Jr. train, Small World, Jungle Cruise, Character Houses, Winny the Poo, and Tarzan's Treehouse. Enjoys Danger Only If Tucked into Your Armpit Level: Dumbo, Teacups, Alice in Wonderland, Buzz Lightyear, Autotopia, and the  acid trip  rides mentioned earlier.Hangs Upside Down from the Monkey Bars Level: Gadget's Go Coaster, Star Tours, Astro Orbiter, and Pirates of the Caribbean. (maybe haunted mansion?)Throw Me Higher, Daddy Level: Splash Mountain, Thunder Mountain, Matterhorn, Space Mountain, and the rest. My kids are by no means thrill seekers, and they attempted every ride at least once. My 5 year old son and I even did the Matterhorn and Thunder Mountain twice. Events:There were a variety of non ride options for entertainment at the park. Between the parades and shows, there were hours of activities to attend. We saw Mickey and the Magical Map which was a very entertaining 30 40 minutes of Disney inspired music and dancing. There is a ton of seating here so don   t worry about arriving early. We also saw a small scale play rendition of Beauty and the Beast at the Royal Theater which was very entertaining with plenty of stich to go around.We saw two parades while we were in attendance and there are specific strategies here. The electrical parade happens twice nightly and rotates around the fireworks (if there are fireworks). It goes from Small World to the main gate first, and then returns for the second showing. Either way you see it, make sure you aren   t chasing it or you   ll miss out. The electrical parade was a ton of fun and I highly recommend it if your kids can stay up. The Mickey   s Soundsational Parade was also very enjoyable, and we got to see almost all of the characters. We had done a princess meet and greet and only had seen two. During the parade, we saw six different princesses and some pretty impressive floats to boot! Seating for the parades starts getting taken up several hours before the parades (I   m not sure why   ) but depending on the size of your party, you can typically find a spot minutes before the parade begins. The main street and central plaza fill up first and then seating fills up radiating out from there. We screwed up a little bit with the fireworks display. We started by watching them closer to Frontierland and the Royal Theater, and then tried to run over to New Orleans Square, before breaking down and heading back towards the central plaza. I hear that there is an amazing view of the fireworks from Small World. The central plaza is definitely the winner though, as you   re able to see all of the light shows projected on the castle as well as the matterhorn. Very fun and I would argue a must if you are visiting. If you   ve either already seen the parades fireworks or they just aren   t your thing, now is a critical time for racking up some ride time. Certain rides will shut down, but many stay open. Find out which are which ahead of time and you   ll bag a couple extra trips down Splash Mountain. Trials of the Jedi Temple is the jedi training program for your 4 12 year old. You can find the signup location behind the Launch Bay near the Autotopia ride. Get there EARLY. As in the first thing you do before you consider Peter Pan. These spots go very quickly, and the shows run throughout the day. I imagine it supports 80 100 kids a day, which may seem like a lot    but those spots were gone quick. Your padawan gets a robe and a lightsaber, and goes on stage to practice their lightsaber skills, and eventually fight a Sith warrior. This is a must do, and the pro togs get some great photos. Try to wrap this into your photopass day if you can.Food:Sunday morning, we went to Goofy's Kitchen, which is a character breakfast that we reserved via the Disneyland iPhone application well, well, well in advance. The Goofy's Kitchen character breakfast was a buffet style breakfast with a specific Goofy photo op at the entrance and several characters randomly parading around and doing table visits. We saw Goofy, Pluto, Chip, Dale, and Minnie. The price for 2 and 2 (adults kids) was $150. The meal was ultimate kid fare: mickey shaped waffles and pancakes, lots of breakfast pastries and desserts, omelet bar, fruit, Euro style meat and cheese selections, and Goofy's signature Peanut Butter and Jelly Pizza. There were even some more lunch y, comfort options if you had a later reservation (or picky kiddos) such as chicken strips, macaroni and cheese, etc. When we left the meal, I was fairly disappointed. For the price, we had three characters come to the table for a quick hug and photo op, the pictures the pro tog (professional photographer) took at the beginning were offered up for sale in a collectible folder for something like $39, and the food was nothing to write home about. Rough start to the trip. One upside was the chef did come out to discuss the food options and what we should avoid to keep our son safe from any nut contamination. This goes a long way, to see someone of importance go the extra mile and personally make sure everyone is safe. My overall assessment is to skip this breakfast and save the money for something else. I would have applied the $150 to three days of photopasses. We also made a reservation for the Blue Bayou (well in advance). This is the restaurant INSIDE the Pirates of the Caribbean ride, and I found it to be worth every penny. I arrived about 30 minutes ahead of my reservation and requested a waterside table and was obliged. The food was absolutely amazing. Disney also does a great job balancing kid   s meals so you don   t feel like you   re just packing their colons with crap. They also do this handy little thing where they bring your kids some veggies and dip before the meal. I   m sure your pack of hyenas will be as hungry as mine, so this is a major victory for Disney dining. We ordered two kids meals and a pair of Monte Cristo   s. The kid   s meals were considerable portions and the Monte Cristo   s were boxed and made a trip home as well, given their size. There was a gumbo and house salad that came with the meals and were likewise delectable. The final bill was around $130 which I felt was acceptable. Did I mention the bottomless NA Mint Juleps?Moving around the park, there are plenty of carts vendors and smaller cafes. We tried nearly everything and I will conclude that you will make your dollar go much further if you eat in the cafes as opposed to the carts. $9.50 for a corndog sounds good when you   re starving, but you can get a delicious steak gumbo bread bowl for $11 or so, and this was far more filling. Another delicious value item was the Chicken Tostada Salad at Rancho Del Zocalo ($12). I think this may have been my favorite splurge. The corndog was good, the popcorn smells amazing, and the churros were alright but you   re going to pay out the wazoo for each and be hungry at the end. The turkey leg was surprisingly filling and worth its value. Our family of four ate at it for 10 minutes or so before giving up the ghost. A nice protein kick for our carbo loaded visit.Dole whips. This is the pineapple craze that is worth the rave reviews in my humble opinion. The dole whip or Dole float, you can   t go wrong. The line can be long, but I   ll let you in on a secret; walk into the Tiki Hut and there is a second bar on the other side that is hardly noticed. Now take the time you saved and go ride Thunder Mountain again. You   re welcome.Disney food aside, it was surprising how lenient the park was about bringing in your own food and beverages. Bring water bottles for certain unless you consider bottles of water at $3.50 apiece to be a reasonable sum. Snacks are a must, and if you can hold off past normal meal hours, you could bring in more substantial food and grab a spot for the parade while you grub up. Characters:This was a little bit confusing, and another reason to definitely get the Disney App. The Disney application will show you which characters are going to be in the park that day, as well as their exact location and what time they are expected to appear. This is nice so you can coordinate your rides with the respective areas. The less than ideal part is the character lines. We waited in the location of a princess appearance, and suddenly Rapunzel and Flynn appeared (my daughter   s favorite) and folks started gathering around her. We had been there 10 15 minutes and blanched when she walked to the far side of the little area and we were told that the meeting line was already closed by her attendant. We managed to negotiate our way into the line because someone decided to step out rather than wait.The story we were given was that as opposed to having signage or waiting areas, the character appearances are fairly random. They   ll just grab a nearby onlooker as the start of the line, stack up 15 or 20 people, and then close off the appearance to all others. To be successful here, be in the area, follow the attendant, and don   t be afraid to hold your ground. The only locations that didn   t seem to follow this rule was the several Star Wars characters in the Launch Bay for Star Wars. Notes:**Note  1   The Disneyland app is ESSENTIAL. Buy your tickets on it, link your photopass, make your reservations VERY early, and become familiar with all it has to offer. We used every function on the app short of finding the nearest defibrillator. **Note  2   Bring rent a stroller. My wife and I went back and forth on this. I was worried about maneuvering, leaving the stroller behind, packing it, etc. I finally gave in to my wife's (better) judgement and boy am I glad we did. Our youngest could have walked, but would have slowed us down considerably. As well, when one of the kids would collapse from exhaustion, the stroller allowed us to carry on. The stroller sped her up, worked as additional storage, and stroller parking is as easy as dumping your stroller on any unoccupied wall. I was worried about thieves, but apparently, the only concern for strollers was if the Disney  stroller attendants  consolidate your stroller further away than where you left it. An identifying marker on your stroller is a great idea. To the family with the flashing LED rope, you shame us all with your ingenuity.**Note  3     Some rides are better at night, especially if you want to do them over and over again. When we did splash mountain at 11 on Sunday, people were literally staying in the same logs and riding back to back to back. There   s also a new level of terror during Thunder Mountain when you can   t see anything throughout the ride ala Space Mountain. We never did Finding Nemo during the day, but found it spectacular at night. There   s also little better time to capitalize on short lines than during the parades or fireworks (if the rides are open). **Note  4     Research the photopass. There are pro togs everywhere and around most of the characters. The characters will move quickly, as will your kids, and those magic moments will pass by quicker than your iPhone will keep up. I have some very nice professional camera gear and consider myself a pro tog, but I didn   t want to lug around my camera on our trip. I was kicking myself after the first couple of days. On the third day, I finally looked into the photo pass and realized you get ALL of the photos for the day for one fixed price. An amazing deal considering single photos of your family screaming on Splash Mountain cost the same. Budget for the photo pass, make that your character visit day, and let the pros handle the heavy lifting.**Note  5     Put your phone on battery saver mode and bring a portable phone charger if you can. If you   re an iPhone user like me and it doubles as your camera, then this should be your MO. We were very successful with this. **Note  6     Set up    Find My Phone    for your device. If you   re tall like me, it means your knees are frequently in your chin on some of the smaller rides. This made my wallet and phone constantly fall out of my pocket. At one point, I actually lost my phone for the better part of half a day. By the time I realized it wasn   t in the room, I was able to pull it up on Find My Phone, and track it to the exact bus it had fallen out on. Big shout out to the ART team here for their stellar integrity and phone rescuing skills.**Note  7     Forget going to Peter Pan first. Every blog says go to Peter Pan first, so naturally, everyone does. Unless you   re able to be the first 10 20 people in line, it will always be a 20 40 minute wait. Wait for the middle of the day when all of the rides are heavy, and do your time then.**Note  8     Fastpass, Fastpass, Fastpass. As soon as you use a fastpass, grab another fastpass. This is going to help you exponentially on the rides that fill up quick, which is all of the mountain rides. If you get a fastpass that is for later in the day, remember that you can grab another set of fastpasses at the time on the bottom of your ticket, usually two hours later. Fastpasses do run out, so be sure to get to them as fast as you can.**Note  9     If you do decide to wait in line for Peter Pan, don   t be afraid to leave brave old mom or dad to Facebook alone on their phone for 30 minutes while you run to two or three rides with 5 minute waits. We did this frequently as it seemed to be the norm. All of the switchbacks in line make it easy for your party to hope a rope or chain towards the end to join their party.

            "Translation error: RIDES AND CHANGES:I am intensely disappointed that Disneyland has essentially turned Tomorrowland into Star Wars Land.I always loved Space Mountain but I was really really disappointed that it has been turned into a Star Wars ride. I also noticed that Captain Eo is gone. I understand that Disneyland wants to upgrade but there are some things that really should just get a refresher. What they really need to do a full overhaul on is the It's a Small World ride. The upgrades to that ride actually make it more creepy and kind of offensive....oh and by the way, who ever heard of ADVERTISING a company like Siemens in a children's ride?! Come on Disneyland, seriously?! I was also disappointed by the new way they do Fast Passes where I have to wait until after the end time of my current one to get another one; that really is inconvenient when some rides put you many hours out into the future by 10am (like Indiana Jones...we got FPs for that ride at 10:30am and it told us to come back at 3:15pm so we couldn't get any additional FPs until after 4:15pm). The Indiana Jones ride, by the way, broke down right before the start window for our Fast Pass, so they let us come back later. And then the end climax of the ride didn't work so we had to ride it again. I remember that ride always seeming to have a ton of problems.CLEANLINESS: Now all these complaints aside...I've never seen Disneyland look so clean. I haven't been since 2010, but prior to that I went nearly every year and this place is looking good.I was very impressed with how clean they keep the park even when there's tons of people everywhere. VERY IMPRESSED.DIAMOND CELEBRATION PHOTOS:We also were there during the Diamond Celebration and we were able to get our photos taken on a photo pass at a whole bunch of different places. Although, I do want to mention that they should have better explained this somehow because we missed a lot of opportunities to do this because we didn't figure out how to identify the spots where you could get photos on a pay pass until the last few hours of our visit. Yes, it's in the guide, but it would just have been awesome to have a more in your face explanation. And buying all the photos is super cheap so that would have been even more cool. You can download an entire day's worth of photos for $39 so if you hit every spot on the map for a special photo, you'd get probably 100 photos. And you can do it in California Adventure, too. My favorite one was the one where they had us hold out our hands and then in the final photo, Tinkerbell is totally sitting in our hands. It was awesome. I am just really sad that we didn't get to take full advantage of all of that.FOOD (Really important if you have food allergies or intolerances) AND CUSTOMER RELATIONS:The restaurants for sitdown eating in both parks serve really excellent food. At one place we had cranberry apple salads with candied walnuts and apple vinaigrette and it was to die for! And cheap. It is a small salad off the appetizer menu but it was filling because it was full of fiber and it was $6. And in any restaurant I've ever been in with something like that, that kind of salad at that size is usually $8 or more so I found it to be a great value. The waiter was also fabulously nice. And I forgot his name which makes me mad at myself because I would have loved to write to Disney and tell them how incredible he was.We're talking Top 5 service encounters of my adult life. In fact, I'd really put him Top 3 alongside the waiters that always serve me at Ruth's Chris Steakhouse. Also, the guy who sold me my frozen chocolate dipped banana was adorable and awesome.And that reminds me. Congratulations to Disney on getting with the healthy program. I was a tad concerned about eating options because I have some food intolerances. There were food stands EVERYWHERE in Disneyland where I could buy huge apples (individually bagged for sanitation!), fruit cups, hummus cups, vegetable trays, even pineapple spears! And they even had Vitamin Water and Vitamin Water Zero. You pay a premium ($2 for an apple) but it was totally worth it because I realize that less people are taking those healthy options and the fact that they made this available to me was really important. We originally thought we'd have to leave the park during the day to eat or pack in a bunch of food and I brought a ton of medication to deal with my intolerances and then not having to deal with all of that was just soooo incredible and was a big stress relief.It was overcast nearly the entire time we were there and I feel that we never waited longer than about 30 minutes for a ride (Space Mountain was maybe 45 minutes but we were in line with a bunch of other people before the ride even opened for the day). Disneyland also seems a much happier place to work because my past trips have always had at least one bad encounter with an employee who clearly hated their job, but everyone I talked to was so nice. We stopped in the tavern in Fantasyland for dinner one night and the girl who runs and ushers the line was just so friendly, and there was another employee off shift in front of me in line who talked to me too the whole wait, too, and then the guy I talked to when I was waiting for my special order was also great. I want to point out again on the food front that everywhere I asked for a special order, the people were VERY NICE and very accommodating. I apologized for making it difficult and was told every time,  You are not being difficult. You have a good intolerance and it is not a problem for us to accommodate that.  And there was a pizza and pasta place in California Adventure where the manager came out and asked me if I would rather have my salad made in the back away from the possibility of cross contamination, and when I said that was not a concern because a little bit of cheese wouldn't kill me, he expressed that he didn't want me to even have a little bit of discomfort. I am really surprised because we live in Utah and most places act like I'm cutting them off at the knees if I ask them to wrap a burger in lettuce instead of putting it on a bun or if I ask them to make my salad without cheese on top. These people were all amazing and it was really great to feel cared about. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"

            "Translation error: So the only weekend we could co ordinate a vacation for our high schooler and university student was on Easter weekend and both chose Disneyland as their first choice. I read many warnings that this was the worst weekend for crowds as well as received it from people that it would be awful and we would be turned off Disney forever. I warned my kids who at almost 18 and 20, still love Disney, we did our homework, we sacrificed sleep acquiescing to my husband's militant wakeup schedule and we had the BEST vacation!HOWEVER, this is not a relaxing, fly by the seat of your pants vacation. The people who are unhappy with Disney have not planned well. If you want to sleep, you need to go back to your hotel and have a nap in the middle of the day. To me, Disney is a magical place for children of all ages, but just like throwing your child a good birthday party, it takes planning.Here's some tips:1 First of all, if you want to get the most out of Disney, I cannot stress enough, you MUST BE THERE BEFORE OPENING, 1 2 hour to 1 hour ideally but even 10 minutes before opening is helpful. The first day even more because you have to get your tickets and have your picture taken if you have a multi day ticket. We got more done in those first few hours than you will get done all day arriving at 10 or 11.2 You MUST have a plan. Look at a map of the parks and decide what rides you want to go to first. Try and co ordinate your rides to one area of the park so everyone's not going back and forth. For your first rides you might want to focus on rides that do not have fast passes, i.e.: the matterhorn bobsleds.3 USE FASTPASSES!We would send one person ahead, i.e.: first thing on entering the park to Hyperspace Mountain for fast passes and then that person would join the rest of us making our way to Indiana Jones, Splash Mountain, Haunted House, Winnie the Pooh, Big Thunder Mountain, where we could get our fill of those rides with short or no lineups first thing in the morning. By the time we were heading back to our fastpass callback at Hyperspace Mountain, we could get another fastpass for Star Wars and got in for a fairly short lineup at Buzz Lightyear. You can get a new fastpass every 2 hours   DO IT! It makes a big difference.4  Download the free Disney ap.I looked at other ones you pay for but this one has everything you need. It tells the wait times for all the rides so we could head to the short lineups and gives locations and times for characters and shows.5 Avoid walking to or from the park.It may seem like just a short few blocks but before or after a 12 or 18 hour walk about all day at Disney, the last thing you want to do is take another step. Our hotel (Homewood Suites by Hilton) was right beside the Disney Parking Lot which has a free shuttle to Disneyland. Mostly though, we took Uber which had great service and was less than $5 for 4 adults   cheaper than tickets for the shuttle.6  Wear comfortable shoes. This is not the time for style. I suggest running shoes with laces but if flip flops are comfortable for you   you may want to throw a pair in your bag to give your feet a change.7  Bring refillable water bottles and snacks. Our best find was the star wars cafeteria where they had ice and water dispenser with the soda.8  Be alternative in the afternoon:The crowds get crazy around noon as non planners pull themselves out of bed and show up, complaining of the crazy crowds. This is the time you can take advantage of the non ride Disney experience:  ALL the shows at Disney are amazing. The Mickey show seats 1600 so you will get in for sure and although I thought I would not like it because it was supposed to be a fantasia type show, I was wrong. I LOVED it. Everybody did. Disney does NOT do bad live shows   they are all professional, talented, and enthralling.  We happened to be around the Royal Theatre and they were putting on a live show on Beauty and the Beast that was also incredible, we made a point of coming back to watch the Tangled show and it was just as good. These shows may be in the Royal Theatre near the princess visiting but they were AMAZING for all ages and genders. They are narrated performed by 2 extremely talented actor singer guys that even had my 18 year old son and husband grinning. A smaller theatre so be sure you are there early but you can bring your lunch in and it is a nice covered spot to eat. Get an ice lemonade, turkey leg from the middle of the Disney square and garlic cheese buns across from the theatre.  There are also street shows all over that are worth a look   sit on a bench and enjoy. The Tiki Room and Mr. Lincoln are old time but are good for a rest for your feet and short lineups. Make sure you grab a Dole Whip at Tiki Room   the lineup is shorter inside! Get a photo pass and take pictures. The photographers are amazing and will not only put pictures on a download for you, they will also take a picture of you with your camera. A wonderful way to commemorate your trip. The other option for busy afternoons is to go back to the hotel and take a break. Make sure you have fast passes before you leave. BY that time of day the really popular fast passes have a wait time often into the evening anyway so you can co ordinate your return with the first fastpass. We left the park, often around 1 or 2 to go to a restaurant, then back to the hotel for a rest in the room or a dip in the pool, or to change clothes and shoes if our feet were killing us. Around 6 we would drag ourselves back to the park when the crowds were thinning again. Parade time is 8:30 and 10:30 and fireworks is at 9:10. People start lining up for parades over an hour or 2 before. If you can stay up for the 10:30, the crowds are smaller. The best place to see the fireworks is right in the middle of Main street and they open up the cord after the parade to let you stand in the middle and watch. If you have a nice day, go see the fireworks as they are cancelled if it is too windy and you might miss out. If you've seen them already, parade and fireworks time is also a great time to take advantage of shorter rides.ALTERNATIVE ACTIVITIES.To me, Disneyland is more than just the rides, its the experience. When our kids were young, we bought them Disney autograph books and the kids had a great time finding and posing with their favorite characters and having them sign their autograph books. Often we had them dressed in their favourite character or princess. So cute. What better place to wear those costumes? Again, judging from the lineups during peak season, this may need to be an early day activity along with rides. When my son was younger, he wanted to do the Jedi Training so bad, we just kept going back until he was picked. My daughter even got picked before him but we persevered and it was worth It.The other thing we started doing was pin trading. The first travel agency we used gave us each 2 or 3 pins on a lanyard. We gave ours to our kids and they had the best time trading their pins for ones they really wanted. Any staff member has to trade with you. Also in many of the Disney stores, you can ask, and they will show you a book or board with trading pins you can trade that are apparently replenished every morning. The next trip we bought lanyards at dollar stores or gift stores on the street   much cheaper than in Disney. They sometimes have old Disney pins there too that you can purchase. This time I ordered a set of 40 Disney pins for $20.00 on EBAY   what a deal! I thought most would go to my kids anticipating the huge crowds but my husband and I used our fair share and had just as much fun looking for our  vintage  pins. I ended up with the entire Winnie the Pooh Silhouette set of 7 pins. Its a great pastime as you are walking around and a momento my kids keep hung up in their rooms.HOW MANY DAY TICKETS DO YOU NEED?We did 4 a day park hopper and by day 3 or 4 we could relax knowing we had done a lot of the  must sees . If we had a 5 day pass, we likely would have hunted down more characters for pictures and maybe taken more mid day breaks so we weren't so exhausted at the end. My kids would have chosen another day of Disney over any other activity in LA. Overall Exhausted but happy. We had friends with teenagers that did both parks in 1 day and they saw most of what they wanted to but you definitely miss things   i.e.: you can't do fireworks in Disney AND the water show at California Adventure   you have to pick one. Personally at a minimum I would do 2 days for both parks. With younger kids, I would go as many days as you can. It is expensive but it is action filled   you get so much for your money.WHERE TO BUY TICKETSI'd buy multiple day tickets online at Parksavers   it was a good deal and you you a  magic morning  with a 3 or 4 day pass which allows you to go in at 7AM before the park opens. BUT YOU NEED TO BUY 3 OR 4 DAYS BEFORE YOU GO! We missed the deadline so we had to buy the tickets at the gate of Disneyland   they don't give you a magic morning   very strange! I take solace in a friend's observation that their  magic morning  wasn't so magical as only part of the park was open and it seems even more crowded.PARKHOPPER OR INDIVIDUAL PARK TICKETS? We debated and honestly the first few days we did Disney one day and California Adventure the second day and didn't feel a need to go back and forth. The third and fourth day, however, we definitely went back and forth as we tried to take in things we missed. Personally I liked the option, especially in the evening when the fireworks were cancelled   we'd head over to California Adventure for their light show. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"

            "Translation error: I thought long and hard on my title, and as have yet, not written poor review for anything, let alone terrible. I just can't believe how little customer service there is, how poor the environment and atmosphere is, and that there appears to be no control over the volume of customers (yes customers Disney!!!) who are allowed into the park. That said, my review is not because today (our second day) a Friday, felt so horrendously claustrophobic and inhibiting for our 4 year old that we left after only 2 hours; 1 hour of which was spent queuing for a ride (auto something) that was an archaic pitiful attempt at entertainment, that goes nowhere, does nothing interesting, and ends with disappointed kids, taunted by the prospect of queuing for 80 minutes to get on the Finding Nemo submarine ride. The crowding is so bad it makes you feel very uncomfortable, unable to move anywhere without being pushed or shoved. If you have children who use a buggy (we have 2 kids one of whom does), then maybe wait until their old enough to not....its just a nightmare...you can't go anywhere with the buggy, even the monorail makes you fold it to use. I was quite surprised by the number of adults in the park without kids, but hey, its for everyone, I get that, but there really is quite a dominating feel to the park by groups of 'big kids' (read grown adults behaving like kids) who can make for an unpleasant environment. Major Point 1: Mickeys Halloween party   Saved by the Light Parade and Fireworks which are spectacular, and the only thing that makes the price of entry worthwhile. Dear Disney, great work on the lights, theme music and all that, but holy crap, the place is full of grown ups dressed up, barging around the place with bags full of candy. It was the least child friendly thing we have ever done of Halloween. Major Point 2: Disney is designed to get the most money out of you in the least amount of time possible. Given that they own everything, and you pay an exorbitant amount of money to get in, get some staff that actually want to work there. I would say 50% of the people we met who worked there couldn't appear more pissed off if they tried. The worst customer service I have seen anywhere in North America. Major Point 3: This is NOT a child  centric   child orientated or friendly place to bring small children. It is certainly more suited to older kids above the age of 8. We have a tall 4 year old, but saw several pre schoolers literally pushed out of the way because they were just too short. At least let them down lightly; maybe a sticker , or badge. There are no chill out areas to go with small one's. Be warned, when its busy it is just hellish. This can't be right in a park with this much real estate? It is so geared to getting money out of your pocket that you have to really work hard to look for highlights. Last Major Point: The Characters....ABSENT ABSENT ABSENT   I used the Disney app to try and track down characters that my 4 year old was dreaming of meeting, and that are littered all over the 'Disney Marketing videos'....we hardly saw any characters in either park. The most characters we saw was in the nighttime parade, other than that they are noticeable only by their absence. It is quite shocking given the price, marketing and anticipation for the kids that you can't find anyone, and the rare few you do you have to que for 30 minutes for the privilege of a photograph.....you HAVE to que because there are so few of them around. Today, Friday 30th in DisneyLand main park, in the space of 3 hours walking pretty much the entire area, we saw Thor and Captain America at the end of a very long que. That was it. After we gave up and decided to leave, we saw a tap dancing chip munk with about 20 people stood around, and a line of 50 people queuing for a picture with a giant pumpkin...that pretty much summed it up for me....Where was Peter Pan, Buzz, Woody, Monsters Inc, The Neverland Pirates, Mickey, Mini, Pluto, and so on. Disney would say, hey they were there, check the app. Well I have nothing to gain by saying otherwise. If they are there you have to search; hard. Which with a 4 year old is not easy in 31 degrees. Shouldn't the theme park be full of these characters enriching the experience? Halloween Party.....shouldn't there be trick or treat everywhere along the stroll, in the shops, on the street, like there is in most places outside on Halloween? Not a few special trick or treat trails with a 40 minute line up of immature dressed up adults? Trick or treat is for the kids, not adults for christ sakes. If they could put the effort and occasion into everything that they put into the the parade and fireworks it might live up to the marketing hype. But they don't The rides are old and tired and appear to be breaking down or in need of repair, the tickets are over sold and over priced, and the food is mostly over priced with poor service and lack of care. All in all I would not recommend anyone visit Disneyland with young kids. Maybe its a different experience with older, more worldly wise kids, but with an almost five year old that things Buzz Lightyear is a real Space Hero, and who truly believes that there is a Neverland with Pirates, its pretty rough constantly explaining that they must have gone to save the day or be having a lunch break....and sorry buddy I know we've been queuing an hour, but we're almost there....oh you need the potty....and yes I know its scary with so many people...save yourself a small fortune an use the money for an actual vacation...their about the same price!!!!! --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"

            "Translation error: En tant que visiteur fréquent de Disneyworld en Floride et actionnaire de Disney, j'étais incroyablement excité de voir enfin l'autre côté de la interprétation du pays sur la magie Disney. J'adore Disney, presque au point que vous penseriez que je ne pouvais voir aucun mal à ce sujet. Au lieu de cela, je dois revoir le parc comme terrible, et c'est même après que la mairie a essayé de rendre mon séjour plus magique (ce qui, même cela, a été dit avec dédain par la femme mécontente derrière le comptoir.) Cela a commencé avec une ligne de 40 minutes juste pour se garer, ce qui a coûté quelque chose comme 20 $, et nécessite une marche de 5 minutes avant d'atteindre des tramways, qui a coûté 30 minutes. Ma mère ne peut pas bien marcher, donc ce fut un début frustrant de la journée, mais nous avons pu nous reposer. Nous sommes finalement entrés dans le parc après avoir acheté des sauts de parc coûteux à 9 h 15. Nous sommes allés à California Adventure en premier à cause de la foule qui attend de monter à Disneyland. Aurait pu être la meilleure partie de la journée, car les lignes de leur plus longue aventure en Californie n'étaient que 95 minutes ... et ensuite nous avons osé aller au Magic Kingdom Style Park de Disneyland. 205 minutes était un temps d'attente normal, et Space Mountain a été en panne puis ils ont fermé Haunted Mansion! La foule était si terrible que nous ne pouvions pas bouger, et personne ne respectait les problèmes de mobilité de ma mère. C'était comme essayer de monter dans le métro à New York à chaque étape du chemin! Des problèmes avec le séjour, en plus de la foule et de l'attente: Disney Dining Packages a été épuisé à 9h00.  Aucun sentiment de fierté des acteurs. Les employés des magasins qui n'ont pas pu trouver le produit que je souhaitais n'ont pas appelé pour essayer de le trouver, ils m'ont shunt au magasin suivant dans la ligne, en citant le temps et un surpeuplement. Les acteurs qui courent dans la rue Main n'avaient aucune passion dans leur performance et ont même arrêté la synchronisation des lèvres avant même qu'ils ne soient dans les coulisses! Mickey Mouse lui-même en chantant la Californie ici, je suis venu a fait des mouvements de main exaspérés pour se moquer du fait que personne ne lui pratiquait l'attention alors qu'ils attendaient pour aller dans les coulisses, se tenant les mains et haussant les épaules alors que sa voix au-dessus prétendait que cette foule se heurte!  J'aurais aimé avoir mon appareil photo, c'était sidéré à assister!  Pire membre de la distribution Faux PAS: Lorsque nous avons demandé à la ligne de manoir hantée commence ici si la foule terrible et la mer des visages fronçant les sourcils étaient vraiment la norme pour Disneyland, il a reconnu notre question en nous regardant, en nous moqués et en éloignant. Je ne peux pas vous expliquer notre choc et notre consternation que c'est inconnu dans Disneyworld.  Les pannes de conduite et sous la dotation en personnel: 2 manèges avec des lignes de pilote unique ne les avaient pas ouverts en raison de la dotation en personnel, selon les membres de la distribution Ride. La seule grâce salvatrice est que la zone de l'aire de restauration de California Adventure avait de la bonne nourriture en bonne quantité à des prix très raisonnables (bien que les boissons soient un peu obstinément à un prix de près de 4 $ chacun.) Normalement, je donnerais une autre star au moins pour le fait qu'à la fin de la journée, nous avons fait une plainte et quelqu'un a tenté de remédier à la situation. Cependant, elle a offert des passes fast-tasses sur notre carte pour des manèges qui ont été fermés, et la poussière aggravant l'intégralité de la mairie, les évents aériens moisis ont aggravé une conversation inconfortable. Elle a été à contrecœur et a offert aussi peu qu'elle ne le pensait pouvoir s'en tirer. Disneyworld chaque fois que nous avons même le plus petit problème va parfois au-delà pour réparer quelque chose, nous ne nous sommes même pas plaints! Ici, nous devions lui suggérer ce qu'elle fait pour nous rendre entiers ... à Disney !! Si vous êtes familier avec Orlando, le service se plie en arrière pour rendre votre séjour précieux et magique. Cette femme voulait juste que nous sortons! Et elle nous a également sortis ... après avoir émis de nouvelles trémies de parc pour réessayer, elle a invalidé nos actuelles et nous a escortés (à l'amiable, accordés) et a finalement offert des excuses spécifiques pour la soirée, qu'elle a transformé en une manière ou d'une autre en une remarque sur Disneyworld, comme si nous étions gâtés par cela. J'espère sincèrement que ce n'était que mon emploi, et non son intention réelle, donc je vais offrir le doute là-bas. Honnêtement, je ne suis pas sûr que nous utiliserons jamais notre essai de Hoppers Park pour visiter un endroit où les acteurs n'essayent même pas de se soucier de la mission Disney, et je regrette sincèrement d'avoir gaspillé notre argent dans les parcs en premier lieu. Nous aurions dû plutôt presser un remboursement. La célébration d'anniversaire la plus malheureuse pour ma mère pour son 60e anniversaire, et c'était lors de leur célébration du 60e anniversaire.

            "Translation error: Let me preface this review with the following information: I have always loved Disneyland with a passion I am a trained medical provider with over 30 years experience I have great sympathy for people who are truly disabled and have volunteered with a local agency that provides guide dogs to the visually impaired. I have raised guide dogs and been a breeder keeper.  I have attended the Disney Institute training required by my employerWe planned this trip to celebrate our anniversary. Decided to go all out and stay on the property for the convenience of being within walking distance of the parks. Also wanted to see the Halloween d  cor and the kids in their costumes as we were there during the trick or treat events (we did not attend, it was an additional fee on top of the passes we purchased, and the park closed at 6pm these nights). As we arrived after the park had opened, stood in line for 45 minutes to enter the park. This was just the beginning of our many  waits  in line. Sure we know about the fast passes but since you can only have one at a time didn't really help with the lines. I wasn't impressed with the decorations, expected much more. Due to the drought (I think?) there weren't the normal beautiful flower displays which add a lot of color and character to the park. For the first time ever, the park appeared worn and outright dirty in some places. The water around the castle was green and there was a lot of garbage, including a dead duck floating in it. Bathrooms weren't all clean. The areas leading to the rides were sticky and some smelled badly. Not the DL I remember. I was immediately struck by the number of people on scooters and the number of double and triple wide strollers. As safety is the number one concern for all Disney experiences, it became quite clear it was very unsafe due to the number of these devices parked all over and trying to maneuver through the park. If there were to be any kind of emergency many people will be trampled or hit. The park was not designed for this type of traffic, along with the thousands of people, especially in the narrower areas especially in Fantasyland. Had stopped behind a scooter that stopped in the middle of the flow of traffic and was struck from behind by a stroller. Had contusions and a great deal of swelling on my leg that was hit. The  dad  stopped and asked if I was okay, I was nearly knocked to the ground and too shocked to speak, he just shrugged his shoulders and took off. I limped over to sit down and struck up a conversation with an employee who said, I quote  You can go over to first aid and get an ice pack. I'm really sorry but wow, you should see the scooter injuries when they run over someone!  Confirmed what I had thought many of the people on the scooters were dangerous drivers! The second point in regards to the scooters. I'm not talking about the veteran who had lost both his legs and had his own scooter, nor the man who had part of his foot removed and was in a real cast, nor the 93 year old who couldn't walk. You see if you claim you are disabled you, and your party of however many you want, get to go in the exit and go to the front of line. Furthermore if you truly need a scooter by Disneyland's protocol's posted at the front of the rides, you would not be healthy enough to ride many of the attractions again not talking about small world! This was every time we got on and off a ride we had to wait for people who came in through the exit. In fact outside of pirates there was again, a safety concern, as there were so many scooters lined up to come in the exit that we could not exit the ride. My fav was the lady impersonating a visually impaired person when she was obviously not. Nor did the dog have the appropriate harness or identification. We were having lunch in Frontierland outside. She let the dog off leash (never allowed in public, unsafe for the dog, all guide dogs are trained to leash relieve for this purpose) and let it go into a display under the fence and poop. Right next to where we were eating. Just so wrong on so many levels. I understand DL has areas for therapy dogs to relieve themselves and this was not one of them!The food was good but overpriced by 50 75% with small portions. The service was hit and miss, saw many employees on their cell phones (not their work phones), yawning, not all super friendly as in the past. Also over heard many complaining about their managers or their hours. Couldn't blame them for complaining about the rude customers because I agreed with them. The magic hour, while a good idea, didn't work out so well in DL because they had several of the areas closed so everyone who came in early was packed into 2 of the areas instead of the whole park. The 60th anniversary fireworks were spectacular, the other nights not so much. So what has changed? Society? Disney? Perhaps a combination of both. Overall witnessed so many rude people, pushing and shoving, grown men and women running nearing knocking over little kids. The scooter group just really out of control. Too many examples to list after a few days at the park. Couldn't help but feel ripped off after what we spent for the package we purchased after dealing with the massive crowds and lines. Lastly, will end as most days at DL should with the light parade. We noticed people staking out their spots 2 hours ahead of time so we decided for one night we would do the same. We sat on the ground for 1.5 hours with specific instructions from DL staff that when they told us to stand, we must stand and remain standing until the parade was over behind the white rope and in front of the rope in the back. Where we were standing there was enough room for one person. For safety reasons, no one could sit on the curb in front of us due to the size of the floats. People became frantic and tried to push us from the back, them from the front to take our spots. The couple next to us, an adult and her elderly mom in leg braces and on crutches, literally had to hold onto the light poll as people were trying to push in. Thankfully a security guard was placed behind us to protect us. The parade was about to start and a lady came running over pushing a small toddler in a stroller who she then dumped out as ran onto the curb. Her husband came up behind with a double stroller, the DL employee tells her she can't stay there, her toddler in the ground crying, and she proceeds to stand and yell at those of us (who have been there for 2 hours) about her  right  to see the parade and who we were preventing her children from seeing the parade. She then turned and yelled at her husband. Really? So we saw the parade, lasted about 12 minutes, so not worth the hassle and all the people who yelled at us for taking  their space.  We won't return until many years later when we have grand kids perhaps by then DL will have figured out how to manage the crowds better. I fear though by then we won't be able to afford to go, seriously do not understand how the family's that were there could afford it! Tips: Don't plan too much in one day. Best not to have a schedule or be on time limits, that is what worked best for us due to the crowds and wait times. Bring your own food. We don't have small children but would consider bringing a small umbrella stroller to store food and water but more importantly to maneuver through the crowds more safely. Go as early as you can. Talked to locals who reported the locals come after school and work thus the park gets busier as the day goes on. Downtown Disney is a nice place to get away from the crowds, but then requires standing in line to re enter. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"

            "Translation error: J'ai eu des conseils de revue très détaillés pour essayer d'aider vraiment quiconque lira ceci pour maximiser son expérience Disney, mais c'était extrêmement long, donc j'ai été obligé de le condenser. J'ai essayé de garder les détails les plus importants, j'espère que cela vous aidera. Si vous allez investir dans un laissez-passer annuel en utilisant leur système de paiement mensuel, assurez-vous de la réussite que vous souhaitez, car si vous changez d'avis une fois que vous vous êtes engagé à un laissez-passer de niveau spécifique et que vous souhaitez mettre à niveau, vous devez payer la différence à l'avance. Exemple: Si vous vous inscrivez à l'origine à un laissez-passer de luxe et que vous souhaitez plus tard passer à un laissez-passer premium, vous devez payer la différence de 230 $ à l'avance afin de mettre à niveau et vous devez toujours continuer à payer vos versements mensuels convenus. Le personnel des billets de billets n'est pas très bien formé pour expliquer ces informations, par entreprise, j'ai été informé qu'ils ne sont pas formés ni autorisés à expliquer cela en raison de la légalité.  AVERTISSEMENT: Les deux parcs sont toujours bondés, peu importe quand vous y allez, il y aura des quantités infinies de personnes; Par conséquent, apportez votre patience parce que vous attendez en ligne pour tout. Pendant les saisons de pointe, les niveaux de la foule sont plus tolérables; Cependant, l'été, Noël, l'Halloween, le Nouvel An et les événements spéciaux sont les pires moments de l'année pour venir au parc, les niveaux de la foule sont si fous que je pense que cela peut être un risque de sécurité et d'incendie. Si vous visitez pendant la haute saison, attendez-vous à des temps d'attente importants pour les manèges populaires (1 hr attend.) Si vous prévoyez de visiter une journée, sachez que vous ne pouvez pas tout faire dans le parc en une journée et que vous ne pouvez certainement pas faire de Disneyland et California Adventure en une journée. Vous vous brûlerez en essayant. Sachez également que CA Adventure se ferme toujours plus tôt que Disneyland; Par conséquent, consultez le calendrier Disneyland en ligne avant votre visite afin que vous sachiez exactement à quelle heure les parcs ouvrent parce que les heures d'ouverture varient également selon la saison. Si vous prévoyez d'acheter vos billets dans le parc, arrivez au moins 1 heure avant d'ouvrir l'heure pour vous donner suffisamment de temps pour vous garer, se rendre à Disneyland, passez par la sécurité et attendez dans la ligne de billets. Préparez ce que vous voulez faire, à l'avance. Si vous avez un smartphone, téléchargez l'une de ces applications gratuites: Disneyland; Mousewait; Walkee. Ces applications vous aident à connaître les temps d'attente, l'index de la foule, les exigences de hauteur, etc. s'habiller en couches parce que le temps Cali est fou comme ses résidents. Portez un écran solaire protecteur de Sun Gear parce que vous marcherez et attendrez beaucoup sous le soleil et très peu de trajets offrent des zones d'attente ombragées. Prenez beaucoup d'eau, sauf si cela ne vous dérange pas de payer 4 $ par bouteille d'eau. Cependant, si vous voulez éviter d'entrer dans le parc en transportant toute cette eau, sachez que la plupart des restaurants fournissent de l'eau glacée gratuite sur demande ou vous pouvez également prendre une bouteille d'eau filtrante vide (comme le genre Brita) et la remplir aux fontaines à eau trouvées autour du parc. Portez des chaussures de marche confortables. Sérieusement, cela est de la plus haute importance. Vous me remercierez pour ce conseil. Si vous prévoyez de manger au parc, faites-le pendant les heures de pointe hors de pic. (Normalement, entre 12 h 14, les lignes deviennent très longues.) De nombreux restaurants offrent la possibilité de faire des réservations avancées, mais vous devez laisser un dépôt de 10 $ par personne et si vous êtes en retard, vous perdez votre dépôt. Emballez des collations comme des barres de granola, des fruits frais ou un mélange de sentiers, pour vous retenir pendant les longues lignes d'attente ou si vous êtes à petit budget et prévoyez de manger un seul grand repas au parc. Procurez-vous un FastPass. Disney Fastpass est gratuit et sont à peu près des détenteurs de lieux, vous permettant de revenir à une conduite spécifique entre un temps spécifié. Cependant, ceux-ci ne peuvent être obtenus que toutes les 2 heures et les trajets les plus populaires s'épuisent rapidement. Suggestion: dirigez-vous vers les manèges les plus populaires et obtenez votre FastPass avant de maximiser. Si vous visitez des tout-petits pour nourrissons, sachez que Disney a un centre de soins pour bébé à service complet gratuit. Nous profitons de cet endroit à chaque visite, depuis l'apprentissage. Total de sauvetage! De plus, si pour une raison quelconque, vous vous sentez malade lors de votre visite, Disney a un centre de premiers soins avec des infirmières disponibles pendant les heures normales de parc. Le Centre FA propose en vente libre et Epi stylos, entre autres remèdes de secours temporaires rapides. Le centre de premiers soins peut également stocker des médicaments qui peuvent nécessiter une réfrigération. Les deux centres sont adjacents les uns aux autres et sont situés à la fin de la rue Main à côté du Plaza Inn. Si vous prévoyez de rester pour les défilés et les feux d'artifice, sachez que les gens commencent à sauver leurs points de vision vers 14 heures pour des spectacles qui se déroulent après 21 heures. Apportez un parapluie pour l'ombre car la plupart des bancs le long de la rue Main n'ont pas d'ombre pour vous protéger du soleil. Une couverture légère aide également pendant les jours froids et à utiliser comme épargnant. Pendant les spectacles, les barrières de corde sont érigées dans tout le parc pour confiner les visiteurs au centre de la ST principale et pour troupeau ceux qui essaient de se déplacer dans le parc dans une direction. AVERTISSEMENT: Pendant la soirée, les invités ont tendance à se presser au château. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"

            "Translation error: I love Disneyland, always have, even into my adult years. This Disneyland trip was rough    You'll want to read these details, and I hope Disney does too. We enjoyed our trip because our attitudes were right, but Disney tried everyone's patience (and I mean everyone in the park).We went as a family of 6, for my nephews 3rd birthday and his first Disneyland experience (along with his mothers first time). We are from Seattle, so we have no qualms with rain, but we will avoid Disneyland if it supposed to rain. Why? Because the rides don't work! Or at least that seemed to be the number 1 excuse from the employees.Friday, May 15th: rained until maybe 2pm or so, that's fine, people had their ponchos and the lines were short :), but unfortunately every ride we tried to ride was shutting down for various reasons. At first it was Space Mountain (when we asked when it would be up and running again, they said 'don't know, but it breaks down at least 3 times a day'   huh? That is never reassuring. Then over to Autopoia   nope, not open due to the rain (will open when it stops). Submarine ride   actually working and was a lot of fun for our group. The little ones loved it, Nemo was a great addition, and the staff were decent. Little Teacups, Storybook Land  shut down due to rain. Matterhorn and Peter Pan closed the whole trip for upgrades. Stood in line at Mad Hatter, sorry folks, the ride has temporarily shut down. Waited another 15 minutes, line moved, great. Oh, ride broke down again   everyone in line must exit. That really was the theme this weekend, even after the rain cleared up and we went into Disneyland again on Saturday, all the rides we went on kept breaking down. I've never been to Disneyland before, or any theme park for that matter, where the rides have broken down so frequently. Even the 4pm Parade on Friday was stopped after 1 float for some technical issue, so was delayed for a bit. The employees kept giving the excuse of 'rain', but when your ride doesn't have tracks that go outside AND the rain has stopped, I think there needs to be a better response to the paying customer. Walking through the park, I remember one family with 2 small kids. The parents were looking for an open ride, as were we and their little girl, maybe 4 years old, starting to whine    'Mommy, Daddy, why does every ride have to be broken?'. Disney, that should tell you something about your audience    we are observant and we are noticing some major issues with your staff and your maintenance of the rides. Haunted mansion broke down 2x while we were on it, then other members of our group tried it again the next day   waited 45 minutes to get to the front to then have everyone in line turned away because it had broke down again. Wow. Splash mountain, 65 minute wait in line, it broke down. Space Mountain, started our 100 minute wait to get to the front of the line and have it break down. A guy in line asked an employee if they knew how long it would be down, the employees reply? 'Two hours'    Then, my husband and I watched that employee turn around and start laughing to another employee. That '2 hour' response rippled down the line of waiting customers and actually made people start turning away. My husband was about the walk out when I said let's wait for the loud speaker announcement. Glad we did, because the ride was running in 10 minutes. Is this the norm now? It wasn't just him though, the employees throughout were noticeably rude, sarcastic, barely smiled (we actually tried telling a joke to the cashier at the Gibson's Ice cream Parlor    fantastic by the way    just to get a small smile out of him), and gave off an attitude like every guest there was an annoyance. Everyone was very routine  this was their job and they couldn't wait for their shift to end. We have been to Disneyland as adults (so we weren't noticing these differences just because we are seeing Disney in a 'grown up' light, and, it wasn't just us that were pointing it out). Maybe we just just went on an off weekend, because my cousin went a few weeks ago and had no issues with rides or employees.While in line for Splash Mountain, the group behind us started commenting on how condescending the guy at the front entrance was when asked about a 'Flash Pass'. They had their terminology wrong and the employee made sure they knew they were wrong. I overheard and told them we had a similar experience with a lady employee working at the Haunted Mansion. She was ushering people through the line with a scowl, rolling her eyes and saying, 'Come on people, keep it moving. Come on, hurry up, we aren't going to bite', with a huge, dramatic sigh that let everyone know she was irritated. When did the employee's at Disney become so miserable? Actually, we met a couple of employees (who weren't in character) who really stood for what Disney is all about. One young lady who was all smiles, eager to help with directions and even walked us to where we needed to go. Another girl near the French Quarters, again very helpful, approachable, and happy to help with our questions. Thank you to Mickey for being so awesome to our 3 year old nephew . You absolutely made his day and ours too!In the end, although it took more time and patience than usual, we were able to ride the rides we desired most and got to see our little nephews face light up over and over. The warm and fuzzy's may not have been there for us this trip, but our focus was him. My family will still enjoy Disneyland for years to come, but I think Disney needs to go back to some of Waltz' basics     be happy! Maybe less advertisements on TV and more money towards the maintenance of the rides and or your employees (we know who you are Disney, and we expect the rides to work when we pay out the nose to visit your park). Again, we love Disney, and we enjoyed ourselves because we wanted to have a great memory for our little one, but there is no acceptable excuse for the lack of customer service and constant broken rides that we all dealt with this last weekend. The 60th Anniversary for Disney is next week and I hope management is reevaluating how they are operating the happiest place on Earth. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"

            "Translation error: I tried very hard to give Disneyland a lower rating, but I just can't do it.We went for 8 days in mid September 2014 with a family of 6: 4 adults and 2 young children. I am not the sort to use the word  magical  lightly: I have travelled a lot and seen a lot of nice things. But Disneyland is still truly magical because of what they do well, which they do better than anyone else.It starts with the staff. I have never had such consistently pleasant and helpful experiences with such a large group of employees anywhere else in the world. They are wonderful people who all genuinely seem to want to be there and they really go out of their way to try to make your experience better. Use them. The  cast members  as they are called helped us so much, from passing on directions and tips on getting into our desired attractions, to answering our questions about all of the many things happening in the park. The staff also go out of their way to help avoid disappointments for the children: for example our 4 year old really wanted to meet Mickey Mouse, but she was next in line when it came time for him to leave. She was so disappointed and we were bracing ourselves for a major letdown. Instead, this wonderful cast member came and took our little girl's hand and asked her to walk with Mickey over to his dressing room. They walked together across the whole main street square and she was overjoyed, successfully turning a disappointment into a magical moment.As another example, our little boy (who is 17 months old) was thrilled with the idea of throwing pennies into a fountain in California Adventure. I had stupidly given him all of 6 pennies to play with, which he went through in about as many seconds. I then had to go into a nearby store, meekly asking for change. Anyone who has done this in their hometown probably knows that you will either get a grumpy  how many do you need  accompanied by an annoyed look, or else a flat refusal to help unless you buy something, accompanied by  I can't open the till  or some other unlikely excuse. In Disneyland? You get a smile, a whole roll of pennies, and a Mickey Mouse sticker.The shows are still wonderful. I can't say enough about the parades and the musical shows in both parks: they really go all out. Every single performer is happy and energetic, the costumes and effects are first rate, and the music is really engaging. We must have watched the Play Parade in California Adventure 5 consecutive times, and each time it was delightful. Here's a tip: find out when the parades are (online is easy, asking a cast member is even easier) and where the parade route is, then go to the attractions nearby around an hour before the parade starts. The parade may start at 5:15 in California Adventure for example, but it is very slow moving and it starts over by the Tower of Terror ride. So you can easily see all of the attractions in Cars Land or Bugs Land, for example, further down the parade route, while half the people in the park are lining the streets waiting for the parade. Then you can just pop on out at around 5:25 or 5:30 and stand right by the side of the street and watch the parade come right by you. If the crowds are too thick where you are for a good view, just move up the street towards the finish and you will probably find a good spot. The cast members do a good job of keeping walkways clear so moving around the parade crowds is not that difficult.The Fantasmic and World of Color shows are really spectacular. Now, the thing is, a lot of people will tell you that you have to line up hours early to see them. Staff will admit that the best spots are usually taken hours in advance. What you may find, though, is the difference between a spot taken 3 hours before showtime and one found 30 minutes in advance might be only 20 feet away. In other words, given the size of the park and the location and scale of the big shows, we really did not find it necessary to ruin half our day elbowing with other people for the  best  spots. My tip for these is: relax a little. Go in the mornings to get your return tickets, and then spend most of the day having fun. In my humble opinion, 2.5 hours of fun rides in Disneyland with your children along with decent seats for a show, is MUCH better than 3 hours of miserably squatting in the hot sun like a jealous hermit crab for the  perfect  spot. I mean, come on, aren't you supposed to be on vacation?The rides and attractions are still top notch, and it is all in the details. The train and main street vehicles are perfectly painted and straight out of the period. Every stepping stone, wall, and doorway in each of the themed areas of both parks are painstakingly decorated and maintained. The roller coaster type rides are dramatic and well planned, the kids rides are adorable and engaging, even for adults. Even the most basic rides like the carousels are great: every single horse (or sea creature) is immaculately painted and kept up: no small feat considering the amount of usage. The only lacklustre attraction we really experienced was the Turtle Talk with Crush show, which is in a surprisingly plain sort of venue, though the technology really is quite amazing and intricate and it probably needs an austere setting to work.And then there are the characters. The whole park, from streets to parades to attractions and events, is populated with a fantastic array of characters from straight out of the Disney movies. The costumes are incredible, and the actors and actresses are excellent. I can't say enough, for example, about the princesses. Our little girl met no fewer than 5 of them by my count, and each and every one of them talked, dressed, moved, and acted exactly like the princess she was playing would be expected to. They are really wonderful with children and did such a great job of interacting with our daughter, I think she will be forever convinced that she did, in fact, meet the real Elssa, Anna, Cinderella, Snow White, and Ariel.That   s sort of the bottom line. Our children were consistently amazed, thrilled, and in wonder of the whole experience, just like last time, and just as I remember it when I was young. Even after the long trip, the stress, the hotel, the lineup, the hot sun, and the unfamiliar territory, it truly was magic for them to see all their dreams and fantasies come to life in such painstaking detail, and so it was magic for me as well. Yes, Disneyland is for children, and apparently children of all ages.Some of the more common criticisms are also not entirely deserved. For instance, I think they are trying really hard to improve the quality of the food. The food has historically been pretty bad there, in my memory. Yet there has been a noticeable improvement, even between 2012 and now. The quality of ingredients has definitely improved, as has the selection, and I've even noticed the menus have become quite a bit healthier than in the past. Yes, it is still overpriced and on the whole mediocre, but there are some actual real options now and, I have to say, some of it is actually pretty good. The Jolly Holliday restaurant on Main Street, for example, has lots of fresh baked options and really tasty sandwiches for breakfast and lunch. The regular coffee there is mostly still pretty bad, but you can now obtain Starbucks in themed shops in both parks near the entrances (In Disneyland at the Market House, and in California Adventure at the Fiddler, Fifer & Practical Cafe) so just pick one up on the way in or out and you're good to go. We didn't get a chance to try the more adult oriented restaurants like the Trattoria or the Carthay Circle Restaurant, but the guidebooks and other travellers have been complimenting them lately. I would say, all things being equal, the California Adventure park does have better food (and better places to eat in) than the Magic Kingdom, so if you are park hopping I would recommend moving over to California Adventure for a late lunch and staying for dinner. If you just plan your day to eat at off peak hours (i.e. not noon or 6 pm), it is pretty easy to get a table and some food without fighting a crowd.Also, the crowd management is not really all that bad. No I wasn   t thrilled with the crowds either. It is definitely busy. But, considering the massive number of people in the park, I think Disney does a masterful job of crowd management. There is almost always a place to sit, to eat, or to watch a show or parade. Walking lanes are kept clear, tripping and slipping hazards are quickly eliminated or cleaned up, and opening times for popular attractions are staggered to avoid massive crushes of people. Disney is well known for designing lineups to try to keep you moving and entertained and, for the most part, I would say they do that very well. And, as a recent veteran of coming to the park before it opens to get my daughter return tickets to meet Elssa and Anna (if you have no idea what I am talking about, then lucky you), I can say that given the shockingly intense and pushy, if not outright insane attitudes of some parents in this world, it is either a modern miracle or outstanding management of people that prevents serious injury every morning. I think it is probably outstanding management.There are also a good number of options for getting inside for a while if it is really hot (and it was REALLY hot when we went): Small World and the Little Mermaid ride are great for a long, slow, air conditioned ride with shorter lineups; Star Tours has an extensive, comfortable, and entertaining indoor lineup area; and it is always easy to catch a nice breeze and some shade over by Paradise Pier. A few other tips for beating the heat: 1. Do Mickey   s Toon Town early or late in the day     it is on a bit of a hill and there is no shade or breeze to speak of, so it is nearly unbearable in the heat of the afternoon. 2. Take transport whenever possible: the train or cars or monorail     they run quite frequently and can save you a really unpleasant walk in the hot sun. 3. Schedule a rest stop     a planned refreshment break and a 5 minute sit down somewhere comfortable can really perk you up in the middle of a hot, crowded day, and keep you going to the end of the day. The Sonoma Terrace in the    Wine Country    area of California Adventure, for example, is a wonderfully secluded and relaxing spot removed from the crowds, complete with shaded trellises, guitar music, wine and craft beers. The Enchanted Tiki Room in Adventureland also offers a nice spot to relax before a show and grab a pineapple drink. 4. Do as much as you can early and late   the parks stay open surprisingly late many evenings, and many of the patrons are otherwise occupied with shows and parades at those times, so the lineups tend to be shorter and the wait is more comfortable. 5. Drink plenty of fluids     the parks will let you bring in as much as you like, so long as they are not in glass containers. And, to be fair, beverages there are not absurdly expensive. Yes, they are not a great bargain, but quite frankly, in contrast with concert venues or sports arenas, they are reasonably priced and only the worst skinflint would risk his health and that of his family to dehydration to save a few bucks. If I had to choose between food and drink, I would bring my own food or eat outside the park where it is better and cheaper anyway, and not avoid buying drinks inside the park. Actually that seems pretty obvious if you think about it that way.Now, the following complaints are completely true: everything is overpriced; ticket prices keep going up; lines are long; crowds are dense; and you need a Ph.D. in logic combined with a personal shopper and a letter from your senator in order to perfectly navigate of the truly confounding combination of admission ticket combinations, different opening and closing hours, magic mornings, return ticket attractions, fast pass attractions, showtimes, parades, wait times, and lineups to get into line so you can line up later (i.e. the Frozen encounter). We gave up the attempt 2 days in and just went with the flow rather than making ourselves miserable trying to optimize our time. I would recommend you just resign yourself to the fact that you will not be able to perfectly maximize your value and time there, and have fun instead.You will almost certainly encounter annoyingly pushy or even outright rude people   though that is probably the case everywhere in the world. Just try to avoid them, and more importantly try not to become one.We were technically there during  low  season, in fact we had been there in September 2012 and planned to return at the same time in order to avoid high season crowds and major holidays. We also ended up there during a major heat wave which you would have thought would decrease the crowds even more. The park was definitely more crowded this time. Still, we were told that it was better than it had been before school went back in Southern California, so apparently the time of year still matters. There are a number of websites (including this one) devoted to discussing the park and especially the time of year to go: if you post a question about your desired dates on a forum there, you will probably get a number of very insightful and helpful replies within a few days, so I would suggest that.And, yes, all in all it was still a magical experience. Really. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"

            "Translation error: We took our 6 year old son to Disneyland (his first time) expecting it to be a magical experience for us all; unfortunately it was anything but magical. We planned and paid for our June trip in January, unaware that June 17 19 was the worst possible time to go. Upon our arrival the first day, we noticed an inordinate number of people...the lines to the rides were 45 minutes to over an hour, although the posted  wait time  was often only 5, 15, or 20 minutes. After the first 2 rides, we asked a Disney  cast member  about the long wait times and seriously large crowd, and she explained to us that this was due to the  day pass  holders trying to get in their last visit(s) before the passes expired...and she added that it would be better for us to come back but not on the 19th because that was  senior day  when all the 2014 grads would be there and it would be even worse. But, we were from out of town and had hotel rooms only through the 19th, so we were stuck. Since we had  fast passes,  we were naively optimistic in thinking that wait times for the 6 rides for which  fast passes  were available would not be an issue since the  fast pass  allows riders to return at an appointed time  with LITTLE or NO wait.  To me, NO waiting means that the riders would pass through the entrance to the ride and walk directly up to the loading area and LITTLE waiting would mean riders would enter and walk up toward the loading area, getting close enough to see people loading and would wait for only a few minutes before being placed on the loading platform or in a seat. Apparently this is not what  fast passes  do. Riders with fast passes approach the entrance to the ride where they may or may not enter immediately...once fast pass riders enter they may walk only a few feet or a few yards, stop and wait... then they eventually make it to the point where they give the fast pass to a Disney  cast member  who will often make them wait before continuing. After this, riders continue toward the loading area where they will again wait before finally loading. Granted, the entire  fast pass  process was faster than what the regular riders endured; however, it was not  LITTLE or NO wait.  We did get lucky on one of our fast passes for Star Tours and waited 14 minutes while the posted wait time was 20 minutes (but it was really close to twice that), but we still waited 70% of the posted time, which I do not consider a  LITTLE  wait. The remainder of our 3 day trip was spent waiting in long lines while watching people cut to join friends and family who had been saving them spots, dodging inconsiderate or inattentive park guests and their stroller wheels as we made our way from ride to ride like salmon swimming upstream, witnessing people enter through exits and then hop the rope railing, and watching rides depart with anywhere from 1 to 4 empty seats time and time again. The one and only time we rode the Matterhorn during our 3 days, we counted enough empty seats in 5 consecutive rides, that an entire ride was wasted. That kind of inefficiency only infuriates people who are trying to wait patiently and enjoy a long awaited vacation in the  magical kingdom . As far as  senior day  goes, it WAS worse. Huge hoards of seniors travelled en masse throughout the park, oftentimes stopping abruptly for no apparent reason and blocking the thoroughfare. They were bay far the worst for line cutting and exit entering. (But we also saw plenty of adults  with their children doing the same.) When we told them not to cut because it wasn't fair to all of us who had been waiting following the rules, they would either glare, ignore, or roll their eyes at us, call us jerks, or try to intimidate us into backing down by puffing up their chest, planting their feet, and staring. When we brought it to the attention of the Disney  cast members  that all this was going on, we were told that they (Disneyland) were doing all they could do to ensure an enjoyable experience for everyone, but that it was hard to catch offenders in the act because there just wasn't enough security to monitor every ride, adding they too did not approve of  senior day  because of the unruly graduates and that the only way to change the situation was to make a formal complaint at Disney's City Hall. So that's what we did. While our complaint was acknowledged and filed, we were politely informed that senior day happens every year and the date is posted on the website, but not as far in advance as January when we made our vacation plans. We, as older parents, have visited Disneyland countless times (as children, teens, and adults,) yet we have never once experienced anything as disappointing as we did on this last trip. Luckily our son didn't know any better since this was his first experience at Disneyland; however he did remark that during our 6 days at Lagoon in Salt Lake City the wait time for rides was basically nonexistent in comparison. We will return to Disneyland, but we will make sure it is well before day passes expire, California schools are out for the summer, and seniors get their  special day  at the park. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"

            "Translation error: Si vous n'êtes jamais allé à Disneyland, vous vous demandez quoi apporter, où séjourner, comment tout faire! Je vais juste donner des conseils qui nous ont aidés à passer une bonne journée. Nous sommes toujours partis totalement épuisés, mais c'est vraiment inévitable. Vous êtes heureux, mais définitivement épuisé. Si vous avez des enfants, vous devez décider à l'avance quand et combien vous dépensez sur des jouets (bibelots), il y a des charrettes avec des rotations, des jouets brillants et de nombreux ballons impressionnants, des barbecues en coton, des sucettes, de la crème glacée, etc. Tous les quelques pieds et à l'extérieur de la plupart des promenades, vous passerez à travers un magasin entier déposé avec des jouets à partir de leurs films préférés. Terriblement tentant !!! Nous avons dit à notre enfant de 5 ans qu'il pouvait choisir quelque chose le dernier jour. Une fois qu'il a connu l'accord, il n'a pas demandé toutes les 10 minutes qui peuvent porter tout le monde! Faites votre accord à l'avance. Vous serez content de l'avoir fait. Emballez dans votre eau de sac à dos (il n'y en a jamais assez et vous paierez environ 4 dollars pour une bouteille d'eau), vous pouvez remplir le vôtre à la fontaine à boire. Crème solaire, vestes légères pour quand le soleil se couche, les chapeaux, les lingettes, Purell, j'ai apporté une paire de chaussures de rechange et j'étais content de l'avoir fait. Ils étaient légers, mais le changement était tellement agréable à la fin de la journée. Tenue supplémentaire si vous avez un enfant 5 ou moins. Nous avons laissé notre fils jouer dans la fontaine d'eau dans le domaine de la vie des insectes et c'était l'un des meilleurs moments qu'il y avait! Une bonne rupture avec la stimulation folle de Disneyland. Il y a des casiers que vous pouvez y louer pour vos extras si vous voulez vous promener dans le sac à dos, mais nous n'en avons pas loué. J'ai entendu dire qu'il y a des plug-in pour charger votre téléphone (dans les casiers), sinon apporter quelque chose pour recharger votre téléphone. Nous avons apporté notre arka et avons pu charger les deux iPhones. Collations. Même s'il y a beaucoup d'options alimentaires là-bas, c'est cher et parfois votre enfant a juste besoin de poissons rouges. Pack 'em. Peut-être une Aleve ou Tylenol pour vous-même, juste au cas où! Tissus. Ils feront un chèque de sac avant d'entrer dans le parc. Pas de biggie, les lignes vont vite ne paniquent pas. Vous pouvez louer une poussette pour 15 $ par jour. Cela vaut la peine même si votre enfant est aussi vieux que 5. leurs jambes deviennent 10 fois plus fatiguées que la vôtre. Au lieu d'entendre porter meeeeee, ils peuvent se reposer dans la poussette. Il y a un parking de poussette à chaque balade. C'est tellement facile. Vous devez prendre la poussette avant d'entrer dans le parc. Park Hopper? Nous avons fait des billets de 3 jours Park Hopper. Vraiment, la meilleure façon serait de 2 jours un jour à chaque emplacement et pas besoin de garer le saut. Concentrez-vous d'un côté, puis l'autre. Les feux d'artifice ne sont que le week-end et du côté de Disneyland. World of Color Water Show est du côté de l'aventure en Californie. Ne vous embêtez pas à obtenir des passes rapides pour cela, il suffit de procéder à une place tôt. Peut-être sur le petit pont. Beaucoup de surpeuplement si vous obtenez la passe rapide, sauf si vous y arrivez très tôt pour monter à l'avance. Vraiment même à l'arrière, vous voyez mieux. Les passes rapides sont idéales pour les manèges comme le Radiator Springs Ride, Tower of Terror, California Screamin. Obtenez ces premières choses le matin. Surtout les voitures rouler. Super amusant et rapide. Pour le côté de Disneyland, obtenez votre Star Wars Fast Pass Indiana Jones, Pirates. À moins que les lignes ne soient mauvaises, mais les avoir est formidable parce que vous vous précipitez dans la fenêtre temporelle. HÉBERGEMENT. Nous avons fait Hotwire et nous nous sommes retrouvés au Travelodge International sur South Harbor Blvd. Vous lirez que c'est à distance de marche (2 blocs) pas vrai. Pendant que vous puissiez marcher, c'est un mile au moins et avec toute la marche que vous faites à D Land, ne l'essayez pas. Le bus s'arrête juste en face des hôtels le long de cette rue. Un billet de bus toute la journée est (Art) est de 5 $ pour les adultes, 2 $ pour les enfants. Ils vous emmènent juste près de l'entrée. Si facile. Vous pouvez faire un taxi et c'est comme 10 $, mais le bus va bien. Vous pouvez acheter des billets chez Denny's ou DoubleTree. Le Travelodge était vraiment rude sur les bords. Divey mais si vous devez faire un hôtel bon marché, c'est faisable. C'était 41 $ la nuit. Il a un micro-ondes et un mini-réfrigérateur et un petit-déjeuner continental. Donc, si vous pouvez regarder au-delà du fait que c'est un peu effrayant, vous pouvez le faire. Je pense que, rétrospectivement, il vaut la peine de débourser l'argent pour être dans le parc que nos amis sont restés au Grand Californien et être dans le parc vous permet de vous fermer pour vous doucher, changer ou vous reposer. Tellement sympa. Peut-être la valeur de l'argent supplémentaire si vous pouvez le balancer. Le restaurant là-bas (Grand CA) était vraiment un bon petit-déjeuner buffet. Il n'y a pas beaucoup de endroits confortables dans le parc pour vraiment se reposer. Vous pouvez vous asseoir sur un banc ou dans un restaurant, mais c'est à peu près tout. Les feux d'artifice sont super. Surtout lorsque Tinkerbell vole autour du château. Mignon. Amusez-vous. Sachez que vous aurez soif et fatigué. Planifiez des pauses. Comprendre que les enfants deviennent grincheux. Apportez des tonnes d'argent pour la nourriture et les jouets, soit décidez à l'avance de votre plan. Il y a maintenant un Starbucks dans la rue principale. Bon. Apprécier!! --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"

            "Translation error: Went to Disneyland the first weekend in January of 2014, and it is simply not what it used to be. I remember when it used to be about family entertainment, and now more and more the it shows that it is a corporate structure that shamelessly cares only about money and not about making the experience a happy one. It was really crowded, though I have been in worse. It should not be a place to go, where you have to think:  Is today going to be a really bad day, or will I be lucky for a change and not have to wait 45 minutes just to get in the front gate?  For a family of 4 (with 2 under nine) just your gate is going to cost you a significant amount of money ($356 1  day one park; $536 one day hopper; $674 2 day one day for each park). And, you have not paid to park, or for any food or lodging. Perhaps it would be nice if you did not have to wait in so many lines. First of the day the tram or the bus. Then, wait to pass through security. Then, wait to buy a ticket. Then, wait at the entrance to get in. Even if the park has just opened, there is still a significant wait. Each time you have to wait in line, you are giving up enjoyable ride time. If you are  too  early, you have to wait at the end of main street for the actual  opening  of the park. So, you have probably spend an hour just getting from your car to the first ride. Did I forget to remind you to go to the line (really short in the morning) to get a locker? And, I won't even address the line to get coffee at Starbucks, except to say the other place was better. Buy one cup and keep your receipt for free coffee refills all day, that beats out Starbucks. Ok. So, I lied, I did address it. Now onto the tips. So, you are at the end of main street    what to do next? If you like Star Tours, go there first and ride it three times in a row, if no line has formed. Then, move on to Space Mountain. Skip Captain EO and Innoventions. Save Autopia for later. While at Star Tours, if you are not going to Space Mountain, go do Buzz Lightyear. If you have smaller children, go to Fantasyland, and do Peter Pan (first if it is open) and be sure to look up at the window in Snow White for the Queen to look out. Then, on to Snow White (touch to the apple    sometimes you need to touch if a few times), Pinocchio and then, Mr. Toad's Wild Ride. If you like Rapunzel, and it is open, this is the time to see her before the line gets too long, like her lovely locks. Then, onto Dumbo, Casey Jr. Train, Alice and the tea cups. Save Storybook land for night time. Then back to It's A Small World (at Christmas this is also one you want to do at night). Then, catch the train to New Orleans Square. Which way to go? Pirates, Haunted Mountain, and Pooh. If you like it do Splash Mountain. If you have young kids, you probably want to do Tom Sawyers to work off some energy. Now, it is time to think about food. Lunch, since you are close, you might want to try the Hungry Bear Restaurant, or any in New Orleans Square (Blue Bayou, Cafe Orleans, French Market or even the River Belle Terrace). No food in this place is economical, so if you have not brought your own, you are going to have to pay. You might even want to consider Rancho del Zacolo. You want to get the most food for your money. When dinner time comes around, you want to plan to sit in the outside of the Plaza Inn, so you can watch the fireworks. Well fed and what next? You still have some big rides, but you are full. So, take in the Mark Twain Boat, and you might even want to to a show at the Golden Horseshoe. Then, onto Thunder Mountain. Go back around to Fantasyland and do the Carousel and Peter Pan again. Then, onto the Matterhorn. If it is starting to get dark, do Storybook land or save it still for later. If you have really small kids and you want to do ToonTown, you can do it now. Then, catch the train again, and stop in Tomorrowland to do Autopia, Space Mountain if you want to do it again and Star Tours, the Submarine and peruse through the shops. You can even do Buzz again, and the Astro Orbiter. If you have timed it right, it should be getting dark. So, cross over to Adventure land and do the Jungle Cruise and Indiana Jones, and back to the Tiki Room. If you still have time and you have not done Storybook land, sneak around the back by the Matterhorn, and do it . Now, it should be time for dinner at the Plaza Inn. Food for adults and kids. We order one chicken dinner and split it. Get a salad and a cup of Italian dressing, and an extra cup to get extra gravy for the chicken dinner. Plus, I must have a dessert. Send someone out to find a table outside closer to the castle so you can have a view of the fireworks. If I am really hungry, someone also gets a cord dog to split. By, now it is time for shopping down main street. Do the left side first. Wander through all of the shops on that side and cross over to the Emporium and shop. Ice Cream at Gibson Girl?? Check out the hat shop last, and possibly visit Lincoln as your final attraction. You do not get to see the parades, but if you want squeeze them in. This trip does not include Fantasmic either, but you will have to save it for another day. If you are going to California Adventure, do Cars first and once again, and then to Soarin' Twilight Zone, if you like and then Crush Talk as many times in a row as possible. Ariel and Toystory are fun. Plus, all of the bug stuff is fun too. Not really much to do or see. Ice Cream at Ghiradeli? If you want to do the water show, you should dine at Carthay for lunch and get the  better  viewing tickets. Best tasting popcorn is near the Haunted Mountain. Sometimes the one on Main Street is burned. This is how I do it when I have large groups of people to take around. Bathrooms in Disneyland? Left and right side when you first enter Main Street. Behind the Plaza Inn near Star Tours. Near Alice. By the Mint Julep bar in New Orleans Square. Past Thunder BBQ towards Fantasyland. Keep those in mind during the day. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"

            "Translation error: As my boyfriend and myself were out to venture a wonderful day at our favorite beloved location, we were terribly disappointed. It was about noon as we had started to develop an appetite so i decided to call The Thunder Barbecue Ranch Restaurant and make a reservation. I had looked up the phone number online and called and had a nice conversation with the cast member. I had asked if it was All You Can Eat as I could recall from my last visit years ago, and she replied, Yes, Its $10 per person. She had explained to me the possibility of a cancellation fee and had asked for my card number to set the reservation on. I cheerfully explained to her that my boyfriend and my self were happy to find this place for its cheap price and our extremely small budget considering that we're college freshmen around Christmas time, shopping for our families soon. Our budget for food for the entire day was $20. So around our reservation time, we had arrived and sat at a table. We received no menus except the dessert menu. We ate the delicious food and had a small talk with the other group seated at our table. We had explained to them what the cast member on the telephone had communicated to us of the $10 per person, drinks included in the All You Can Eat, and the desserts were excluded, etc. As the waitress appeared, the other group had inquired about it and the waitress had informed us that the food was $24.99 per person and the cancellation fee was $10 per person. We were absolutely upset about our new findings. We had explained to the waitress of what we were told and how we only had a certain amount of money for the rest of the day and our budget. We were so upset because of the miscommunication and that we unknowingly had spent about $50. The waitress was wonderful and expressed her apologies for the misunderstanding and had tried to see what she could do for us. At the end of the lunch, she had told us  Sorry. They said that the price was displayed on the website too and we can't do anything about it.  I had told her that I had only searched for the phone number and intended to ask more information during the phone call of which i was misinformed. She still said there was nothing she could do. After this, my boyfriend and myself found ourselves broke. We had barely enough to pay for the dinner and our day was ruined. We intended to only spend $20 on food and no money on anything else. We ended up spending $50 that day and my boyfriend found out he lost his job on the same day. We later went to city hall to graciously tell our story and to explain of our misunderstand and the miscommunication of the cast member who made the reservation. The cast member at city hall took my name and said he was going to listen to the phone recording and see what happened. So he went to the back room and we waited about 20 minutes. He came back out and told us that he had talked to the woman who was on the phone with us and she had told him that she established the price and the $10 person was only the cancellation fee. He told us there was absolutely nothing to do for us. He was a very ignorant and arrogant worker who had no intention of helping from the very beginning. We left city hall for 20 minutes or so seeing as how we were greatly upset by the horrible customer service as I perfectly remembered the conversation with the woman. I specifically told her that we were on a low budget and happy to hear of somewhere inexpensive to eat, this was right after she expressed the price was $10 person of which i understood was the buffet cost. I thought it over and remembered how the city hall cast member said he would listen to the phone recording but later came back and said he had only spoke to her and she said she had established the $24.99 buffet fee. We went back and had asked him to listen to the recording, he said  We don't record our phone calls.  and I called him out on telling us that he was going to listen to the recording. We also told him how we told the woman of our low budget after she told us the fee. He had said  Yes she told me that but I didn't think I should bring it up.  He went back to his supervisor to see what could be done but when he came back, he explained that there was nothing they could do and that the woman said she explained the fee. There was no menu to display the buffet fee, and nobody had bothered to explain it as we entered the Thunder Barbecue Ranch. Now my review is not solely based on the lack of display of the buffet fee but particularly to the horrible customer service. As it is supposed to be  The Happiest Place on Earth , they did absolutely nothing to ensure us of continuing our day to be a good day at the park. He was very arrogant, lied about listening to the phone call, and offered nothing for our horrible experience. Im very disappointed as a huge SoCal Disney fanatic, I will have to say that I'm not sure of another trip to the park even after my 100 or so visits. It is easy to see that the business is all about money and this place does not stand by  The Place where wishes come true  or  The customer is always right  I was not requesting a refund at all. A discount for the miscommunication would have been fine or anything to make our day better after the disappointment but this was never the City Hall cast members intention. Very disappointed and I hope he gets fired. He was not an appropriate worker for a place that assures customer satisfaction. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"

            "Translation error: If it was possible to rate them a zero I would have. While I realise that Disneyland and Disney   s California Adventure are two separate parks they much of what I have to say applies to both parks. There is not enough information out their about either park for first time visitors. They cram to many people into to smaller space and charge way to much for it. It seems that the only way that Disneyland is value for money is if you live in California, pay monthly for an annual pass and spend most of your free time there. For staff that are responsible for moving a lot of people all the time, their crowd control is terrible. It seems to me that they have given responsibility to people who are to young and inexperienced, resulting in people who are on a power trip telling people what to do and where to go that is not conducive to getting anyone anywhere in a timely and efficient manner. The scheduling of things within the parks also seems to be an issue. For instance there is no way you can see both Fantasmic! and Fireworks at the Disneyland Resort, and have good views for both, due to the times they are scheduled for. Yes I accept you can see the fireworks from just about anywhere near the parks, if you want to see the Fantasmic! by the water then see the fireworks in front of the castle it is pretty much impossible. And forget trying to catch something in the other park. And for those of you saying go to parks on different days or get multiple day passes, what about those who can not afford the extra days or who do not have the time to spend in Anaheim as it is stop over on their trip somewhere else. Two big issues Firstly, lazy people on motor scooters that they hired at the park. I am by no means tiny. My BMI would put me into obese at the very least and I was repulsed by the number of lazy people driving round on these. Who seemed to be spry and agile to get into the lines and onto the rides but could not walk between them. I was in the park from 9:00 am until midnight I was by the end of it, I could have kept standing if I had to. The longest time I stopped and rested was the half an hour I spent sitting on the sidewalk along with thousands of others watching the parade at Disneyland. If you can   t walk the whole time don   t go. I have no problem with those who brought their own scooter because they needed it, but scooters should not be an option for laziness. Secondly, parents with children far to big and old in a stroller. Once a child is a certain age it should work (baring any medical conditions that require assistance). One women had an eight year old in a stroller. That is far too old!! And again these strollers are hired at the park. Fair enough have stroller hire for those who have travelled some distance to get their and weren   t able to bring the stroller for their little one but should they really be readily available to all and sundry who can squeeze their 8, 9 or 10 year old into one. Then they have massive areas filled up with stroller parking. One of which was prime viewing location for Fantasmic!The only thing I absolutely wanted to get at Disneyland was a picture with Mickey. I found a Mickey out and about, got in the line and then was told the line was closed come back later as Mickey has other things to do. Would that have been their response if I was child!Fast Pass, line time estimates, the phone app and line cutting.All very very annoying and all mean we line up for even longer. The day I was there the glamour rides all had three hour wait times and many had no fast pass. The estimated line times were not even close to being correct. For example on the board in California adventure it said 30 minutes, at the ride it said 45 minutes, the wait was over an hour. The phone app may be useful for those who live in California (shocking) and are therefore not paying roaming charges and who can check the waits before even leaving home. There was no way I could have used this app I would have spent a fortune on data charges to find out I had to line up forever. And then there are the people who put one person in the line, who texts everyone else when they get close to the front, who then push their way through the line, essentially cutting in. And you get people who wait for the shows hours before the start again saving space for lots of other people. Shame if there are only two of you and you only have limited time in the parks so one person can   t sit in a prime viewing spot all day saving space. High points (I did manage to have a couple):I did have one lucky break at Disneyland and it was purely by accident. I happened to be walking passed the entrance to Splash mountain just as they were reopening it. The possibly only helpful staff member we struck all day said to go now as know one was in the line. Walk straight onto the ride, which was fun and got soaked. Don   t think I would have been quiet so impressed if I had to wait three hours to ride though.I would say to anyone who does go, don   t rule out the non glamour rides. I loved the mad hatters tea cups and could have rode them all day. Lets just say if I ever go back to Disneyland it will be way way too soon! --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"

            "Translation error: We were a bit disappointed by our Disneyland experience because the cutting of so many corners seems to have been a bit too obvious this trip. We visited between 9 30 and 10 3, four day park hopper tickets. Here is my list of grips with Disney that I wish they'd work on for future visitors. 1. Got a call from guest services two days before my long drive down the coast to tell me that I should have been able to purchase convention tickets after all, although their website clearly stated those were not valid until 10 2. The gentleman also told me that the  3rd party  tickets I purchased from aRes Travel would NOT be redeemable at the hotel check in desk. (He was incorrect on both counts, and his phone calls was clearly a sales pitch full of ignorance or deception). I was not impressed. I made several calls to Disney to find out why the $1,000 I spent on tickets was now being called fraud, and they wouldn't guarantee to redeem the ticket vouchers. You can imagine the stress this caused when every person claimed to not know and not be able to help me. aRes assured me it would be fine, and it was. Disney is not friendly to guests who use a travel agent to purchase tickets. Shameful. 2. Staff at Disneyland Hotel were not at all friendly. Their helpfulness seemed forced; they seemed burned out. They forced us to use their bell hop service and would not allow us to park and load our own luggage. They took our car keys from us (in case of an emergency!) while in the loading zone on our departure. Rude. (The pool staff and Steakhouse 55 staff and experiences, however, were amazing. I can't explain the inconsistency. If the front desk and valet staff and housekeeping get their act together, then I would go back, but not the way it is now.)3. Early magic hour was the most horrible thing ever. The lines were longer than the normal opening lines. The entry in the Grand Californian had a 2 hour wait time to get in! So the resort guests have to use the regular line anyway. Their tech is not warmed up, so the lines move slowly and their iPhones are not working. They want to re photograph you every morning. Then, when you get in, only Two lands are open, and all the best rides in each of those are  down due to an emergency.  AKA, there are barely any cast members in the park, and most of those are there to turn you away. It is a ghost town during the Extra Magic, which is a total waste of time.So NOBODY got to ride Racers in Carsland that day, and the main rides in Tomorrowland, Star Tours, were down for the entire extra Magic hour. None of the restaurants, the River Belle Terrace for breakfast opened until after 10, so our plans were all completely delayed or ruined each and every day, due to  budget constraints  and  emergencies.  4. To top it off, a giant (I mean giant) spider was dangling from the monorail structure in Tomorrow land and hit a man in the face. It was horrible. I know from staff at Disneyworld, FL, that they fog their park regularly. Disney was full of ferrel cats, and the worst spider I've ever seen. The web hung down over 6 feet. Staff who saw the problem pretended not to notice! *With a four day park hopper we still didn't get to do all the rides we had hoped to because the extra magic hour was a complete non starter, a real dead duck. They actually had staff installed at all the randomly closed (my favorite Frontierland and Adventureland) doors to turn us away due to budget constraints. I would have been fine with it if they hadn't posted on their site that only Mickey's Toontown would be unavailable. No, it was literally almost the entire park. No food opened until after general opening, and all the main rides were down in the areas that were open. What is the point? I don't know why more people are not complaining. From a management standpoint, they are just barely staffing the park until opening at 10 am to save money. Period. Every ride in each open land could not have possibly been down for the entire Extra magic hour. It' was insulting our intelligence. They just won't deliver the goods. Shameful.Other than that, the Halloween overlays on the Haunted Mansion and Space Mountain were a huge hit. The shorter hours during the week and the lack of fireworks at night, coupled with the Extra Magic being worthless means that October is not the best time to visit after all. The weather was nice, but without the ability to have the time to do the rides we came to do, it was frustrating. I felt totally scammed by the Extra Magic Hour; reviewers who claim it helped them rides Racers and other such high demand rides led me believe Disney was up and running on time, which they were not for three days running, so I am pretty sure they are not consistent about that. Don't expect much from Disney. Finally, my biggest frustration is that all their food establishments close at 8 when the park closes at 9. So you are forced to eat in Downtown Disney and even that was closed our first night when we left the park. Same with our hotel restaurants, with exception of Steakhouse 55, which was great. Why don't they leave the food establishments open longer, at least until closing? I don't like leaving the parks tired AND hungry. Disney has long since held such high standards that I really think if they don't intend to really be open yet, they should not advertise the Extra Magic hour as such. Either be open or not. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"

            "Translation error: Too many things to do for just a one day visit. I   ll focus less on the what to do at Disney and more on how to get the most out of your visit. We travel from Canada every few years for a few days of Disney. I   ve been back a dozen times or so over the years. I recommend getting a multi day park pass. Especially one that has a    Magic Morning    on it. A Magic Morning pass gets you into the park one hour earlier than the general public and Tomorrow and Fantasyland are the only parts of the park that are open. Im under the impression if you stay at one of the Disney resorts you get multiple magic mornings, so that might be a valuable consideration. Or get a Southern California pass (buy it from Universal Studios, use it there 1st and you get two days Universal Studios admission instead of just one if you buy it elsewhere). Southern California pass has a 3 Day Disney admission   one Magic Morning, 1 Day At Universal Studios (or 2 day, see above), 1 Day Sea World. Pass must be used in full by 14th day after 1st use.Now heres how to get the most out of your day at Disney:1. GO EARLY! Be there when the gate opens. Especially if you are on a Magic morning pass. In this 1st hour you must focus on the rides that get long lines during the day like space mountain, Peter pan and Star tours . You will virtually be able to walk right on these rides on your MM. 2. If you go for general admission 1st thing in the morning, still focus on space mountain, Indiana Jones, peter pan, splash mountain as you will have the shortest ride times of the day (15 20 min). Ride times start to get stupid by about 11am when the parks fill up.3. As soon as you hit the park, start plugging your park pass into fast pass machines. Disney FASTPASS Service is a complimentary benefit to all park Guests that allows you to enjoy the rest of the Disneyland Resort while your place in line is saved. You return at the time on your fastpass ticket and can ride with minimal wait time, bypassing the general ride line. Only certain highly popular rides offer fast pass service. Keep an eye on your next eligibility time for a FP and always keep your fast pass active waiting on a ride. 4. Consider riding as a    single rider    to avoid long ride lines. My Kids are teenagers now and riding together all the time isn   t so important. As a single rider you can bypass most hour long ride lines and get on in 10 min or less.5. Consider leaving the park for a mid day break. We leave by about noon every day, go to the hotel and have a nap, a meal, a swim and a beer. We spend the heat of the day in the pool, avoid the long lines (60 min   for popular rides) and then return after supper about 630pm. By that time people with small kids and the early risers seem to call it quits for the day and ride times start to drop. 6. Ride times at the popular rides seem to drop during the evening fire works, meal times, parades and during the Fantasmic shows. Plan to ride stuff like peter pan and the matter horn IMMEDIATELY after the fireworks are done, and I mean IMMEDIATELY. During the fireworks make sure you stage yourself north of the castle somewhere in or close to fantasyland. When they start pulling the ropes down from the fireworks, go to peter pan. There will be no one in line and you can get right on. Other wise you will spend min 45 min to ride it at any other time of day and there   s no fast pass for it. Go from there to Matterhorn and you   ll get on in only a few minutes vs 45 60 min. Go from Matterhorn to Nemos subs and you   ll get on all 3 of these attraction in rapid succession within 25min.7. If you don   t take a mid day break from the park and ride times are getting long, try using the park hopper to go across to California adventure park. Sometimes its virtually deserted.8. If you have a smart phone, down load and use    Mouse Wait    app. It will give you a real time status of ride times. Get use to using it PRIOR to going and check various times of the day in the weeks leading up to your planned Disney visit and you   ll get a good idea of what rides will be chaos at what times of the day before you go and you can plan for what park to be in on what day of the week and what times.9. Visit Magic Kingdom on week days. On the weekends it gets BUSY!!!10. If you can make it, stay right until closing. During the last 45 min while everyone is beating the rush out of the parks after the last Fantasmic shows, do the Adventure Land rides. They are virtually abandoned and you can go straight on stuff like Pirates of the Caribbean, Jungle Cruise, Haunted mansion and splash mountain. 11. Splash mountain is packed all day and as soon as it gets dark and cooler its ride times drop. The down side is you   ll be cold and wet so if you plan to do this bring a cheap dollar store poncho and ride till your hearts content.12. The ART (Anaheim resort transit shuttle) offers a cheap $5 day adult pass to get you to the park. Keep in mind that the last shuttle leaves Disney    hr after park closing. Also ask the shuttle drivers if any other routes get you near your hotel. Chances are the neighboring hotel has a different route and if its in the shuttle mall it beats waiting for your particular route shuttle by going to the hotel next door. Our hotel had 3 routes that went by it.Lastly Big Thunder Mountain Railroad is down for renovations until November 2013.If you found something in here helpful, please click helpful below.

            "Translation error: J'ai eu une expérience très désagréable pendant que je visitais Disneyland Resort, Anaheim, le 31 décembre 2012, oui, c'était le réveillon du Nouvel An, et c'était vers 23h30 quand j'essayais de prendre le compte à rebours du Nouvel An et les feux d'artifice à Disneyland (à partir de 22h00 à 23h20, j'étais dans le parc d'aventure en Californie pour voir le World of Color Show). Je voudrais partager mon expérience avec vous et j'espère qu'il y aura une amélioration de la procédure de Disneyland pour les laissez-passer de plusieurs jours.J'ai eu un billet de 5 jours de parc de parc et je suis entré correctement Disneyland, j'ai présenté mon billet et mon identifiant photo pour la dame nommée Isabella (si je me souviens bien) Disneyland pour noter mon nom sur le billet le premier jour de ma visite, après cela, j'ai continué à utiliser mon billet, l'encre s'estompe seule, rien que je ne pouvais faire à ce sujet. Elle a insisté pour dire que le stylo était la marque permanente, l'encre ne devait pas du tout s'estomper. J'ai dit que si l'encre s'estompe, alors le stylo n'était vraiment pas une marque permanente. Elle m'a demandé de me retirer en disant que quelqu'un vérifierait mon billet, je n'avais pas d'autre choix que de suivre la commande, cependant, je ne m'attendais pas à attendre plus de 10 à 15 minutes (c'était comme pour toujours) pour récupérer mon billet. J'étais pressé de rejoindre la foule pour le compte à rebours et les feux d'artifice, mais la dame Disneyland et son avance ne semblaient pas du tout s'en soucier. Ils ont pris leur temps et n'ont même pas pris la peine de se soucier de mes préoccupations. J'ai demandé à la dame quand je pouvais récupérer mon billet et pourquoi il a fallu si longtemps pour vérifier le billet, elle a simplement répondu à mon avance, avec votre billet ... avec une atritude très arrogante, froide et négligente, et aucune explication sur la raison pour laquelle cela a pris si longtemps. J'ai dit avec impatience que je devais attraper les feux d'artifice, mais elle s'en fichait du tout !!! Tous les membres de ma famille sont entrés avec leurs billets, mais ils devaient m'attendre, ils ne comprenaient vraiment pas ce qui n'allait pas avec mon billet, mon nom était toujours là, juste l'encre était légère, il n'y avait pas de signe de billet pour m'avoir utilisé, J'ai demandé à Robert pourquoi il a fallu si longtemps pour vérifier mon billet, encore une fois, il a simplement dit oh, j'avais besoin de valider votre billet .... D'accord, vous pouvez valider mon billet, mais avec le parc Disneyland de classe mondiale, il a fallu plus de 10 à 15 minutes pour valider un billet? Et j'ai été bloqué à la porte pendant près de 20 minutes au total du début à la fin. Il n'y avait aucune excuse du personnel de Disneyland! J'étais tellement frustré et bouleversé. Toute famille entière est allée à l'hôtel de ville et j'ai parlé à la direction. Nous avons soulevé nos préoccupations au sérieux; Alors que nous étions à l'hôtel de ville, nous avons raté le compte à rebours et le début des feux d'artifice, nous nous sommes précipités à l'extérieur et avons regardé les feux d'artifice à partir d'un point de vue pas si bon, mon père a raté tous les feux d'artifice depuis qu'il a continué à discuter de nos préoccupations avec le manager. Si quelque chose n'allait pas, c'était le stylo, le stylo a été fourni par le parc Disneyland, je n'avais rien à voir avec cela. En raison de la mauvaise marque permanente, cela a gaspillé les 20 minutes précieuses de mes membres de ma famille le soir du Nouvel An, et le temps de signaler nos préoccupations.J'ai visité Disneyland, LA, deux fois en 2011 avec mes billets de 5 jours et 6 jours, j'ai apprécié mes visites et j'ai estimé que le personnel de Disneyland était très amical et bien formé. Mais l'expérience que j'ai eue en 2012 a complètement détruit ma bonne impression sur Disneyland. Nous avons déjà ressenti beaucoup de désagrément de montrer à la fois les billets et les identifiants en 2012, puis en plus, beaucoup de soupçons et de méfiance. J'ai payé 300 $ pour mon billet et je ne pensais pas que je devrais être traité comme de cette façon. Je pense vraiment qu'une nouvelle solution devrait être venue pour répondre à cette situation. J'ai vu d'autres invités avec les billets valides étaient également bloqués à l'entrée; Pour moi, cette expérience est l'insulte et l'humiliation ultime. J'utilise toujours des billets valides, et avec les billets, je n'ai jamais été bloqué à la porte ailleurs, sauf Disneyland. Nous venions pour le bonheur, mais pas pour la méfiance, la chose intéressante était, après que cette dame réécrit mon nom sur le billet en utilisant le stylo, quelques jours plus tard, l'encre s'est à nouveau fanée! J'ai toujours mon billet avec l'Ink Faded Ink.Disneyland n'a pas eu une bonne procédure pour les billets de plusieurs jours, la procédure actuelle ne fonctionne pas !! Le stylo n'était pas en fait une marque permanente, par conséquent, Disneyland devrait prendre la conséquence, mais pas moi, pas les invités !!! --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"

            "Translation error: You know, I just can   t help it. I have to be unbiased and truthful, even when it pertains to Mickey Mouse. Disneyland is NOT the happiest place in the world.It is the happiest place in the universe!With so many fantastic recent updates and changes, there is still that special something that can not be described    a feeling that can not be duplicated    when walking below the plaque that reads    Here you leave today and enter the world of yesterday, tomorrow, and fantasy   . And it   s true, isn   t it? Try to walk around Disneyland and think about your bills, or the report that is due on Monday. I bet you a churro that you can   t do it!A day at a Disney theme park is one of the few things about today   s society that I can honestly and truthfully say that I believe is worth the money. In this economy, quite a few families may be thinking about visiting less frequently, but in my opinion, cut back on take out. For after all, can one really put a price tag on magic?Disneyland, as always, is unparalleled, whether it be 90 degrees or 65, or whether the wait times are 10 minutes or 60. But people, remember to make use of the FASTPASS! As with a lot of other theme parks, this is not a paid perk, but a powerful tool that every attendee with a ticket may make use of. Simply find the FASTPASS kiosk for participating rides, slip in your ticket, and out will pop another ticket with a time to return to the attraction. (See! I told you there was magic!)If you have never visited the Disneyland park, shame on you! You have been missing what I refer to fondly as    the mountains       my personal Land favorites. Take a whimsical journey through the briar patch before plummeting down a prickly waterfall on Splash Mountain, feel as if you are flying through the stars on Space Mountain, or speed down ice covered terrain, pursued by the abominable snowman on the Matterhorn Bobsleds.Of course, there are the favorites that we all know and love    that seem timeless    transporting us back to memories from our childhood, or assisting to make new ones with our own little loved ones. Seriously    what would the world be without Pirates of the Caribbean, It   s A Small World, the Haunted Mansion, the Jungle Cruise, or Peter Pan   s Flight? It sure wouldn   t want to be a world that I would want to live in!I especially love some of the older, smaller attractions that are not present at Walt Disney World. I will squeal like a six year old on the Casey Jr. Circus Train, the Storybook Land Canal Boats, Mr. Toad   s Wild Ride, or Pinnochio   s Daring Journey. And for you Alice fans, don   t just expect to spin about on the Mad Tea Party, but follow her down the rabbit hole on the Alice in Wonderland ride!And no one has the ability to update attractions, without losing the original components that cause it to be so beloved. Star Tours is an excellent example. What was once a regular (as    regular    as anything Disney could possibly be) motion simulator, has gone 3 D! And the infamous 20,000 Leagues under the Sea, is now sailing through different waters in the Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage.Please    please do not leave the park without making a round on the Disneyland Railroad. Much more than just a way to get from one area to another, this is truly an attraction in itself. Plus, Walt would have wanted you to. Say no to that!A lot of folks still refer to Disneyland as one theme park, but Disney   s California Adventure becomes even more a force to be reckoned with! While housing such fan favorites as Soarin    Over California, the Twilight Zone Tower of Terror, and It   s Tough To Be A Bug, the themed areas range from a land seen from the eyes of a bug to the perfectly created Paradise Pier, complete with a coaster and Disney   s zany idea of a ferris wheel.But what everyone is talking about is Cars Land. This is Radiator Springs straight out of Pixar   s Cars. There are new shops, new restaurants and yes, new attractions! Yay!The Radiator Springs Racers is just about one of the FUNNEST rides I have ever experienced. Cars holding six people zip through scenes and characters from the iconic Cars movies, and then the real fun begins. Hold on tight    because your car will soon find itself in a dead heat race with the vehicle next to you. And by the way, my car DID win.Mater   s Junkyard Jamboree is an attraction for the entire family. Whip around with the baby tractors to playful music that makes you remember why you love Mater so much in the first place!Luigi   s Flying Tires is just    for lack of a more profound description, fantastic! Seated in your giant tire, prepare to fly across a surface that may best be described as an enormous hockey table. Great job, Imagineers!And if you want to party, head to the Mad T Party! Let me prepare you, this is no cartoon concept. Hello, Mr. Burton, and pour me a cup of tea! This appeals to all audiences, but has an    edge    that shows Disney is more than prepared to do the unusual and the unexpected, and with applause rendering results! Expect zany d  cor and flashing lights, a rock band, and not your three year old   s Alice. Dance to the music, surrounded by toddlers, teenagers, couples, and hoverounds. Only Disney could make this level of diversity work! Better yet, leave your expectations asleep under the tree with Dinah, and take the tumble with the White Rabbit. After all, you don   t want to be late, do you?The close proximity of both Disney parks in California make it possibly to zap from one park to the next, so I would definitely suggest buying those park hopper passes. While it is feasible to visit both parks in one day, picking and choosing which attractions you would like to ride, I do not think that one can experience, well    the    experience    without feeling rushed and anxious to move quickly from one bit of happiness to the next. Don   t sell your visit short. Try to spend a full day at each park, and a third would be nice to    hop    from one to the other, revisiting your favorite places and catching the ones you may have missed on your first visit.In a perfect scenario, stay a week, catch all of the great shows, and don   t forget to spend some time (and money) at Downtown Disney, the premier shopping spot from everything to Disney souvenirs to makeup. (Yes, girls, there IS a Sephora!)Also keep in mind that while each park hosts a plethora of delectable dining options, remember that the Disneyland hotels, Disneyland Hotel, the Grand Californian, and Paradise Pier Hotel, all offer several restaurant choices a bit away from the hustle and bustle.My absolute favorite is the Storyteller   s Caf   in Disney   s Grand Californian, just connected to Disney   s California Adventure. Yummy!But if looking for a good option within California Adventure, check out the new Flo   s V8 Cafe in Cars Land for an amazing breakfast, served on real dishes at fast food prices! The lunch and dinner offerings range from sandwiches to steaks, and are equally as impressive.In Disneyland Park, check out Red Rockett   s Pizza Port. This is not your regular theme park cardboard pizza. This place has awesome pizza, salads, AND pasta! The Count Down Chicken Fusilli is out of this world    pun intended.As I leave Disneyland Resort, my stomach is full of goodness, my hands full of shopping bags, my feet are sore but still ready to explore, and I have stars in my eyes.People often speculate if Walt Disney had any idea that a few sketches on a drawing board would result in a place so full of imagination, wonder, and happiness.I think that he did. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"

            "Translation error: First off, I'd like to address all of the people who are giving Disneyland California Adventure negative reviews. Based off of the reviews given by unhappy Disney consumers, I have concluded that most are upset about a few main points: A) Disneyland is crowded, B) Disneyland is  expensive  and D) There was some other factor that was unrelated to Disney that made your trip not enjoyable. I have come up with some explanations about why these critics believe this way about Disneyland. First, I will address the  Disneyland is expensive  issue. One day park hopper tickets to Disneyland and California adventure cost $80.00. This ticket includes admission into BOTH parks, all day, usually from 8 AM until Midnight. A one day (single park) ticket to Six Flags costs approximately $70.00 for hours that are about 10:30 AM to 8 PM. I'm not saying that the two are comparable (Obviously Disneyland is a way better deal) But when you consider everything that you're getting, it's clear that Disneyland really isn't that expensive. You get the opportunity to watch off Broadway shows, can watch Fantasmic and World of Color, get admission to all of the rides as many times as you want, meet several Disney characters, and get to experience Disney magic. If you think it's too expensive to pay 80 dollars a person at most for a full day at Disneyland, to watch all of their amazing shows, and to experience all that Disney has to offer, chances are you're probably just a cheap person. You'd pay close to the same amount even when you're not getting half as much at some other parks. As far as food goes, if you're unsatisfied with the the cost of food, there are plenty of other places you could go within and around the parks to accommodate the price you want to pay for the food. There are several to go food places (Pizza port in Tomorrowland, Corn dogs on Mainstreet, etc) where you can enjoy quality food at a lower price. If you're unsatisfied with how the food is prepared, then you should be prepared to pay more for your food  just as you would when you are going to restaurants outside of Disneyland. There are several high end restaurants for you to choose from (the Blue Bayou, Steakhouse 55, etc). Again, check an online or print guide about Disney to review all of your food options. Next, I will address the crowd complaint. Anyone with half a brain (or a fourth of a brain, or anyone who has the intelligence to research a trip before the plan it) can figure out that there are indeed certain times of the year that are busier than others. There are months, weeks, and days that are known to be EXTRA busy in Disneyland, and if you research your trip beforehand you'd know when those times were and know when to avoid them (check a website like mouseplanet.com or buy a Birnbaum's official Disneyland guide to get details about times of the year that are most busy). It's also important to note that when the parks are more busy, it's more likely that rides are going to brake down. Disneyland isn't perfect   there are going to be rides that break down throughout the day, just as there would be at any other park. Just because you experienced many ride closures doesn't mean that they are constantly that way. Many people are unsatisfied about the Disneyland wait times. However, Disney offers many solutions to not have to deal with as many long wait lines. The fastpass, when used correctly, can save the guest hours of wait time. Getting fastpass as frequently as possible insures the guest that they will maximize the amount of attractions they will get in within a day at Disneyland. Again, anyone who is intelligent enough to do their research before visiting the park would realize that long waits are usually avoidable. Again, if you choose to go at a busy time of year, you should expect to wait in longer lines. The last thing I noticed when I was reading the negative reviews were factors that were completely unrelated to Disney. They rated Disneyland negatively because they bought tickets from a shade vendor (and complained when Disney didn't accept), they were unsatisfied with their off property hotel, or they weren't happy because of the weather or because of the  outdatedness  of Disneyland. Those who were upset with their trip need to realize that it's not Disney's fault when you purchase Tickets from a shady vendor, nor if you are unsatisfied with your off property non Disney hotel. Likewise, Most of those who believe Disneyland is outdated believe that it's too childish   but it's clear that those people don't know what Disney is about, and are completely unaware of the fact that much of the park has stayed the same for a good reason   because Walt made it that way. If you take one thing from this review, know this much   Disneyland is what you make of it. Your trip to Disneyland can be as magical as you want it to be, or as miserable as you make it. If you're looking for a reason to gripe, groan, and complain, then I'm sure you could find plenty of reasons to do that while at the resort (your feet, after all, actually do hurt after about the third day). But if you're looking for a magical Disneyland vacation, do your research, plan your trip well, and are looking for a great place to go with your family, you will have a wonderful time. It's almost guaranteed. Disneyland is a great family oriented vacation spot for children of all ages.  I only hope that we don't lose sight of one thing   that it was all started by a mouse.  --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"

            "Translation error: Never in a million years did I think I would like Disneyland more than Disney World. After 5 spectacular trips to Disney World in the last 9 years, I had significant doubts about my decision to travel to Disneyland. I was convinced that nothing could trump my love for the Magic Kingdom; but, boy was I wrong!We had purchased the special deal that afforded us 5 days in the park for the price of 3; however, we only had 4 full days and 5 nights to spend. So, our first view of the park occurred around 7:00 PM in the evening (with closing time being at midnight). When we arrived, I was not the least bit impressed by the Entrance Plaza, nor was I enthused with the Train Station. And, when we walked down Main Street, the only thing I could concentrate on was the wimpy castle. I was completely underwhelmed and almost in tears. I tried not to show my disappointment, but I sincerely wished that I could click my heals and be transported to Orlando.That first evening, we had 7:30 PM reservations for The Blue Bayou. To get there, we navigated our way through Adventureland, and made our way to New Orleans Square. I must admit that through the entire walk, I must have been in a stupor, as I don't remember much of it. All I recall is checking in at the restaurant, turning around, and being awakened by the allure of the unique shops, the lively jazz music, the stunning architecture, and the positive energy of the area. At that moment, I took a deep breath, and allowed the Disney magic to consume me. When our name was called to enter into The Blue Bayou, we were immediately transported to a different time and a different place. It was quite dark (as it is perpetually twilight in this restaurant) as we walked along the terrace to our table beside the river, where the pace was slower, the air was richer, and the atmosphere was one of intrigue and mystery. As we looked up, my daughter and I found that we could not see the ceiling...it was if there was no end to the  sky . It was simply divine to watch boat after boat gently float by as they began their journey toward The Pirates of the Caribbean. To be honest, I can't remember what we ate; all I remember is that it was good and it was also expensive. Yet, we felt so special and so lucky and so smart at having made the decision to start our Disneyland experience at this magical place.At the conclusion of our meal, most people were in position around the lagoon to watch Fantasmic, so we were able to  hop right on  to the Pirates of Caribbean. That also turned out to be a wise decision, as each day thereafter, this ride always had ridiculously long lines (except for during Fantasmic). As we got into the boat, we were tickled to see The Blue Bayou from a different perspective, and smiled and waved at our waiter as we floated by. Needless to say, we found it a bit peculiar to begin in the bayou, yet somehow end up in the treacherous waters of The Pirates of Caribbean; nevertheless, none of that mattered, as Disney has a way of seamlessly making all things work out. By the way...the ride itself was very similar (if not the same) to that in Orlando.The rest of that first evening we spent walking around and making plans for the next day. As we slowly strolled about, we took in all the scenery and marveled at the details. This is one of those elements that makes it so strikingly different from The Magic Kingdom (I make this comparison, as Disneyland is most like the Magic Kingdom in Orlando). When I told my husband this, he asked me to explain; but, I really couldn't. It's just that every square millimeter is magical; everything is perfectly placed; meticulous attention is given to every single aspect of the land. That's why I was so glad that we opted to take the first evening just to look...to notice all those details and to make sure they weren't overlooked...to see everything as they are meant to be seen. It's so easy to get lost in the hectic shuffle as you rush from ride to ride. If you have time, I strongly recommend that you stop and look...really look. You'll be glad that you did! During the next four days, we spent three in Disneyland. We arrived 45 minutes before park opening, and were shocked to see that there were already so many people waiting in line. This didn't end up being a factor, as once the park gates opened, we quickly headed in the opposite direction than most of the crowd. For the first time in our Disney experience, we honed in on one area of the park, as a way to save our legs and to maximize our time on the rides. The first full day we focused on Adventureland, New Orleans Square, and Critter Country. We were the first to arrive at The Haunted Mansion, and rode it two times. In between times, I rushed over to Indiana Jones and got a Fastpass. We then rode Splash Mountain twice before lines ever really formed, and got another Fastpass for later in the morning. After that, we rode Winnie the Pooh, enjoyed its shop and some delicious chocolate, then went to the Pirate's Lair on Tom Sawyer's Island. After a little more than an hour on the Island, I obtained a Fastpass for Thundermountain Railroad, and we went to ride Indiana Jones and Splash Mountain, at which time we were then able to ride Thundermountain. While my family ordered our meal at Critter Country (which had a lovely view of the lagoon and the island) I headed over to get another Fastpass for Indiana Jones. With that being said, we really worked the Fastpass system, and rarely waited more than 10 minutes for any ride. This side of the park has more opportunities for such a system, as we soon found out the following day, when we toured Tomorrowland.What were our favorite rides? Indiana Jones, the Haunted Mansion (although it's different on the outside, it's very similar on the inside), Splash Mountain, Space Mountain, It's a Small World, and Buzz Lightyear. Truthfully, however, we enjoyed each and every ride and were able to do almost everything at least twice. Naturally, not to be missed is Fantasmic! But, be sure to get there early, or you will struggle to find a spot to see, as the cast members will not allow you stop in any of the walkways just to sneak a peek! Moreover, we were awestruck by the fireworks spectacular, and were almost brought to tears. Any spot is a good spot to see the fireworks; but, if you are lucky enough to be behind the castle, you will have an up close and personal experience with Tinkerbell as she careens down the cable from the Matterhorn Bobsleds to the castle. Our only real disappointment was Peter Pan's Flight, as it was so much more dated and less magical than the one in Magic Kingdom. On the other hand, we were pleasantly surprised by Fantasyland at Disneyland, with so many more delightful ride options, such as Alice in Wonderland (so cute) and Mr. Toad's Wild Ride. We were equally surprised by our fondness for the castle, especially since we were so disappointed upon first sight. It is actually quite splendid, and you can actually walk through a portion of it, during which time you can    participate    in the story of Sleeping Beauty. Perhaps even more surprising was Toontown. It definitely is not one of my favorite spots at Magic Kingdom, but it is a real kid pleaser at Disneyland. We really could have spent hours upon hours here! We were also surprised by how chilly it gets in Anaheim right around 6:30 PM. As a matter of fact, we wore sweat shirts, and many of the cast members had on long winter coats! So, keep that in mind as you make plans to visit Anaheim.In many past Tripadvisor posts, I have read how irritated some people are with the commercialism of Disney (i.e. all the shops). I must say that I rather enjoyed each and every one of them, as they are all different thematically, and truly offer quality merchandise. You always have the option to say  no  and to avoid the shops altogether, but we found them to be a nice option when the crowds are large and our feet are tired. Plus, we like to have mementos from our trip, and do our best to make wise purchases. Our favorite shops were in Adventureland and of course, on Main Street. In regard to restaurants, we highly recommend The Blue Bayou and the Carnation Cafe (on Main Street). We were lucky enough to have a table reserved a half hour before the parade was slated to begin, and were able to enjoy the parade while eating our yummy supper. Along with that, you absolutely must get reservations for The Plaza Inn character breakfast. We snagged the very first seat at opening, and were greeted by a plethora of characters. Chip and Dale were especially playful, as they constantly teased my daughter and played with her long hair. Naturally, we loved the characters from Winnie the Pooh; Eeyore was especially sweet, as he lumbered around our table for most of the time. At one point, the characters began dancing, and Hook took our daughter by the hand, and invited her to dance. It truly was a highlight of our trip. And, yes, the food was great too!I don   t' know about you, but when I'm on vacation, I crave fresh fruit! You will find plenty of it in the park. That leads me to our favorite treat at the Tiki Juice Bar in Adventureland...Dole Whip soft serve. Believe it or not, this is the one and only thing we waited in line for while at Disneyland (and it   s a long line!). After this epic depiction of our Disneyland experience, I just want to reiterate how joyful this place is. While you do spend a lot of hard earned money, it was worth every penny to us. We were there at opening, and stayed until closing. We strategically planned everything, from the areas of the park we worked, to the times where we rested our feet; yet, we also felt free to just throw our plans aside, and just enjoy the splendor of this magical place. Although we still love Disney World, and will likely visit again in the near future, we much prefer Disneyland to the Magic Kingdom. So, do not miss a chance to go to Disneyland...it is just what the kid inside each of us craves! Enjoy! --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"

            "Translation error: I just returned yesterday from a 5 night stay in Anaheim, CA visiting Disneyland and California Adventure. We stayed from Feb 19   23, 2008. We were fortunate enough to have an Uncle in LAPD and he was nice enough to get us 3 day hopper passes for $56 each. Which is an incredible deal since one day, one park passes are $66.Unfortunately the second day my ticket got taken away. All of the other members of our family were able to get in fine (everyone got their name on their ticket) but unfortunately mine got messed up, and instead of my name it had our Uncle's name. The first day I had no trouble coming going from Disneyland, but the second day when we entered for our Plaza Inn breakfast a very rude CM took it away without explanation and made me wait 20 minutes for his manager to explain to me what the mix up was.After the manager (who wasn't much nicer) told me they were taking my ticket away, and finally gave back my ID. I had to buy one day passes at $66 for the next two days and ended up spending a lot more on tickets than I wanted.Besides that we had a wonderful time at the parks. In case you guys are wondering I am a huge Disneyland fan and always plan to go to the parks in late January or early February. It did rain in the mornings while we were there, but by noon it cleared up. And the rain scares the SoCal residents away so the wait in lines are non existent.On Friday morning there was a wait of 3 hours for Nemo. We came back at around 7 PM during the Parade of Dreams and the CM said the wait for Nemo was a 1 2 hour. We got in line and an hour and a half later we made it to the front. We were disappointed that the CM had lied to us about the wait time (they weren't even close and she was specifically advertising to everyone it was ONLY a 1 2 hour; a lot of us in line were discussing how off she was) but despite that it was still shorter than 3 hours.Besides Nemo the longest wait we had was a 1 2 hour at Indy. We walked on Pirates, Haunted, Splash, Star Tours, Tower of Terror, Monsters Inc, Muppets, Tiki, Tough to be a Bug, Pooh... and had about a 20 min wait at Screamin, Soarin, Thunder, Mr. Toads, and Storybookland. We used fast passes on Space and Roger Rabbits and walked right even though they had a 40 min stand by wait.In Feb 2006 we had visited as well about a one week apart difference from this year's visit. We noticed that Tiki and Small World had several problems with not functioning birds and dolls. Small World was closed (to fix the boats since they are supposedly having a problem with the population being heavier than before) but when we sat through Tiki all of the birds, tikis, flowers were functioning perfectly.The crowds were so wonderful, I couldn't complain. Although it seemed for no reason they closed Tom Sawyers Island, even though only in the mornings was a drizzle. They also randomly closed the Tea Cups, Alice, Thunder because of the rain but reopened later in the evening on Fri.We ended up walking from our hotel on Disney Way to the park. It saved us $12 a day (that's $36 for 3 days) and was very close to the walk from the tram to your car in the Mickey & Friends parking structure (especially if you parked way in the back). We also saved money by eating one meal in the park (lunch since its cheapest) and then just munching on a churro   popcorn   cotton candy until dinner. (Have breakfast out of the park, as well as dinner  will save you loads of cash) Although churros   popcorn   cotton candy is about $3 each. Soda runs from anywhere from $2.69 (for a cup) or $2.75 (for a bottle).We really did have a magical time, and Nemo was cute. If I really had to wait 3 hours to see it then I don't know how I would feel about it. The loading unloading time for that ride is ridiculous. We also got to do the new  Pirates  since it reopened with Capt. Jack Sparrow and Barbosa. We enjoyed the Davy Jones smoke screen but was kind of annoyed at how much they mentioned Capt. Jack throughout the ride. It was a bit overkill and I missed the original. Although the last shot of Capt. Jack with the treasure was fitting and better than those two pirates pushing the treasure up the lift.Some more tips for you travelers:  If you are going to eat at Blue Bayou (inside Pirates of the Caribbean) make reservations a couple of weeks before you visit the park through Disney Dining. Also if you are on a budget make reservations before 3:50 PM as their lunch prices are 1 2 of their dinner prices. Lunch prices range from $21 35. If you want waterside seating ask when you check in, it could be anywhere from 15 45 mins extra to sit by the water. The restaurant has wonderful atmosphere, good food, and excellent service.  Another great place to get more bang for your buck is Rancho Del Zocalo located in Frontierland. They have huge portions that you can split with someone. Also good food.  If you are on a budget for Disney souvenirs you can get some pressed pennys from 50 cents to $1 in the Crystal Arcade on Main Street. You can also go to the Disney Outlet store located on Harbor past the 91 where they still carry current items inside Disneyland for normal (instead of exuberant prices)  During the parade   fireworks do rides that have abnormally long lines like Nemo. You'll only have to wait 1 4 to 1 2 the time when something isn't going on.Anyways I  3 Disneyland and had another wonderful time. Hopefully next time I'll finally be able to see the fireworks (they were canceled due to winds) and eat Plaza Inn's Character Breakfast! --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"

            "Translation error: Nous avons visité Disneyland lors de la célébration du 50e anniversaire et pour moi, c'était très décevant. Nous avons visité le 20 février 22. Nous avons acheté les Hoppers de 3 jours Parker afin que nous puissions visiter Disneyland et California Adventure. Ce fut la première visite de mes filles qui, à 7e et 4 ans, étaient très excitées à l'idée de visiter Disney. Nous avons sorti 7 ans de l'école pendant quelques jours et nous avons pensé que février serait le bon moment pour visiter et nous pourrions éviter les foules énormes qui convergent sur Disney pendant les mois d'été. Eh bien, nous avions tort. Il semble qu'il n'y ait pas un très bon moment pour visiter et éviter les foules énormes. Notre premier jour était un lundi et c'était des vacances, donc nous nous attendions à ce qu'ils soient bondés depuis que l'école était sortie. Les mardi et mercredi suivants n'étaient pas meilleurs. Il semble que beaucoup d'autres personnes aient la même idée. Les seules fois où nous avons pu faire l'une des manèges ont été la première chose le matin. À midi, il était impossible de faire un tour sans avoir à attendre bien plus de 45 minutes à une heure. Certains manèges avaient le passage rapide qui a bien fonctionné, mais qui n'est utilisé que pour certaines manèges et même alors n'est pas toujours utilisé. Il y a une ligne pour tout chez Disneyland et California Adventure. Vous attendez en ligne pour faire vérifier vos sacs avant même d'entrer dans le parc. Le troisième jour, la ligne était vraiment longue. Une fois que vous entrez dans le parc, vous devez attendre en ligne pour leur montrer votre billet. Une fois à l'intérieur du parc, les lignes commencent vraiment. Vous attendez dans une grande ligne de groupe bondée à Main Street pour que les manèges réels à ouvrir. Ensuite, quand ils s'ouvrent, il y a une course folle, mes adultes avec de petits enfants et des poussettes pour se rendre aux manèges. Si vous ne faites pas attention, vous pourriez être écrasé. Lors de notre visite, nous savions qu'au moins 2 manèges seraient fermés. Le premier jour, nous avons fait la queue pour le Cer uniquement pour qu'ils le ferment alors que nous approchions à cause d'un problème. Nous avons finalement pu le monter le 3ème jour, mais nous avons entendu plus tard le même jour qu'il a été fermé à nouveau. Spash Mountain ne courait pas les 2 premiers jours, enfin à la fin de notre 3ème jour, nous avons vu qu'il courait. Nous avons finalement pu faire certaines des manèges que nous voulions faire. C'est juste très frustrant et presque comme le travail au lieu de s'amuser à faire les manèges. Même essayer de monter dans les manèges Kiddy a été difficile. Nous avons attendu au moins 30 40 minutes pour monter les tasses à thé, ce que mes petites filles ont beaucoup appréciée. Je me demandais juste si les 4 hommes adultes en ligne devant nous l'avaient aussi apprécié. Les adultes faisaient la queue pour les manèges pour les petits enfants, je ne comprenais tout simplement pas. Le pire était probablement les gens très grossiers. Les gens qui se pressaient devant vous afin qu'ils puissent avoir une meilleure vue d'un défilé ou d'un personnage. Ils poussaient leurs enfants devant d'autres enfants qui se tenaient en ligne pour voir l'un des personnages. Nous sommes restés en ligne pendant environ 25 30 minutes pour que mes filles aient une photo et un autographe de Cendrillon et de la Belle au bois dormant. Ils y sont arrivés, mais j'ai dû souligner cet homme où la ligne a commencé. Si je n'avais pas fait que mes filles auraient manqué car les princesses devaient partir après avoir vu mes filles. Les gens ont commencé à faire la queue le long de la rue à 6h00 pour le défilé qui a commencé à 7h15. Nous nous sommes assis une table près de la rue Main environ 30 45 minutes et avons commencé avec une assez bonne vue sur l'endroit où passerait le défilé. Juste au moment où le défilé se préparait à commencer, les gens ont essayé de nous épargner où nous étions assis. Essayant de pousser leurs enfants devant nous, éloignant les chaises de l'endroit où nous étions assis et même debout sur la table. Et puis ces mêmes personnes étaient entendues se plaindre parce que leurs enfants ne pouvaient pas voir le défilé. Il y avait un chemin pour beaucoup de gens, la nourriture était trop chère, les acteurs n'étaient pas très sympathiques et nous n'avons presque jamais vu aucun d'entre eux sourire. De ma mémoire de visiter quand j'étais enfant, cela semblait être un endroit beaucoup plus agréable à visiter. Pour le prix que nous avons payé, nous sommes repartis très déçus ce que nous avons obtenu pour notre argent. Il semble que la seule chose qui est importante à Disneyland est l'argent. Il semble que personne ne s'en soucie plus. Câche dans l'eau, les salles de bains sentaient et le papier et les poubelles dans les rues. Je suis content que mes filles aient pu visiter Disneyland, mais ce sera longtemps avant de revenir. Ce n'était tout simplement pas une très bonne expérience pour nous. Réfléchissez à deux fois avant de dépenser votre argent sur Disney. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"

            "Translation error: We were at Disneyland on Friday 4 8 and at California Adventure on Saturday 4 9. We got in at 10:30 and there was about a 5 minute wait to go thru the bag inspection tables and another 5 to go thru the turnstiles. A friend of ours already bought us the SoCal 2fer tickets and so we didn't have to line up for tickets. By the way, we are not from SoCal but our friend was. Apparently they only check IDs when they sell the tix but not at the turnstiles because we got in without anyone checking to see if anyone in our group was from SoCal. By the time we got in, the park was teeming with people already. I had planned to go to the Winnie the Pooh ride first thing, but a character sighting derailed that plan. Because of our late entry and judging from my son's reaction to the park so far (it was our first time at the park) I realized I had to ditch my well researched plan (I researched many internet sites and more than a couple of guide books for this trip) and just  go with the flow.  Next stop was the Dumbo ride. We waited for almost 45 minutes to get on, but it's a good first ride for preschoolers. Dumbo was a familiar character and the ride is really easy to take and gave my son a sense of control (since he could make Dumbo fly higher or lower) over the situation. After that my son warmed up more to the idea of getting on the rides than meeting characters. So we did a couple in succession   Pinocchio's ride (not worth waiting in line for), Gadget's roller coaster (exciting enough ride for preschoolers but not too scary for protective moms). Then we watched the Snow White show which was a good break from all the walking and standing in line. Before we went on the rides we got a FastPass for Buzz Lightyear's Astro Blasters. And so by the time we finished the 2 rides and the show, it was close to our FastPass time. We squeezed in a quick lunch at that eating area in Tomorrowland and was pleasantly surprised with a Buzz Lightyear appearance. I think he's there most times of the day for about half hour appearances and then he takes a break and comes back again later. The Astro Blasters ride was a blast. It was the best ride according to my son (who's 4). At the end of the ride, I got to email a picture of us and our scores to my home email account. It's a great souvenir. We went back to our hotel (HoJo across the street   will post another review for the hotel by itself) for an afternoon nap. We went back to Disneyland around 7pm via the ART (cost us $3 roundtrip) and this time we needed to wear light jackets as the air was getting quite chilly. We went on the Pirates of the Caribbean ride and the lines were moving quickly because people were flocking to the waters' edge to save their seats for Fantasmic (yes, it was 2 hours away but the roped off areas were filling in fast). My son realized he needed to use the bathroom just as we were about to get on the boats and the cast member was kind enough to let us use the bathroom and come back thru the exit and not wait in line again. The ride was too scary for my son (he doesn't like spooky noises and the ride starts off with that) although he wasn't bothered by the 2 sudden drops in the ride. When you exit from the ride, you enter a replica of New Orleans' French Quarter which was neat for someone who's been at the real place. As we exited from that land, Fantasmic was just starting and we managed to squeeze into a spot near Tarzan's treehouse where I made my son stand on the fence giving him a good view of the show. Tarzan's treehouse itself was blocked off. He called it the Magic Mickey show because the lights, sound, and holographic effects were just awesome. He wanted one last ride and I made him choose between Winnie the Pooh or Buzz Lightyear. He chose Buzz and patiently waited for almost an hour in line just to get in. By this time it's already close to 10pm and the lines are still that long. So if you can get FASTPASSES to this ride, do so. By the time we exited, there was hardly anyone along Main Street most people were staking out their places for the 2nd Fantasmic show. By the way, I was surprised to see that Disneyland is dark at night. I didn't get to appreciate the buildings and other sights because apart from the streetlights and the lights from the shops and entrances to the rides, there was not much illumination. However, there were still a few characters milling about and we got some photo ops with Pluto and Chip n Dale. The next day, another late start for California Adventure. This time you could tell that the locals were out in full force. So much more people than Friday, more kids and teens and less  tourist y  people looking at maps and looking like they were lost. I made a beeline for the Soarin' over California FASTPASS station. We were there around 10:45 and our FASTPASS time was already for 1:35. In between we caught mostly shows in the Hollywood area. Muppets 3D was fun for my hubby and I because we recognized the characters from when we were growing up watching the Muppet Show. It was fun for my son to experience the 3D effects. After that we caught the Aladdin show which was awesome! They even had Aladdin riding an elephant around the Orchestra section. If you sit on the Orchestra, you see the  parade  up close and you're closer to the stage. If you stay on the Mezzanine, you get to see Aladdin and Jasmine and then later the Genie closer as they soar in their magic carpet ride. Along the way to these shows, we saw the lion from Jojo's Circus and also Mr. & Mrs. Incredible; a Disney princess was there too but my son wasn't interested. There wasn't any signs indicating they were going to be at a certain place, it was all by chance. We had lunch at the Burger station served by McDonalds at Paradise Pier. The meals were about $2 more expensive than they were at regular McD's outside of Disney. Then my hubby and son rode the Zephyr which was on again after an earlier period of time when it was closed down. There was no reason posted why it was closed earlier. This ride lasted maybe a minute, if at all. Not worth a long wait. We walked to Bug's Land where they rode Heimlich's chew chew train which amused my son. Again, a very quick ride. But maybe worth the wait for it's cuteness factor. Bug's Land by itself is a  cute place  so definitely worth a visit for preschoolers. We also got on the bumper cars shaped like one of the characters in the story. By then it was past the time for our Soarin' FASTPASS. But apparently, as long as you come after your designated time, you can still get on the FASTPASS line. So even though our time was set for 1:35   2:35, at 4pm they still let us on the FASTPASS line. There was also a singles line that seemed to go as fast as the FASTPASS line. That was another awesome ride. Although I'm afraid of heights and get queasy pretty easily, the special effects of the ride was enough to distract me from my queasiness and I actually enjoyed it. My son liked it so much he wanted to get on again. But at this time, the standy line was going to take over an hour before they could get on the ride, so no way was I going to stand that long. We had another event to go that night and so that was the end of our Disney visit. Although I didn't follow my detailed plans, I still ended up enjoying the trip. Everyone else was right in saying that one day is not enough to experience ALL of Disneyland or DCA, but if you're willing to skip some attractions and be spontaneous about what you can do, the visit will still be fun and memorable. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"

            "Translation error: C'était ma 8e visite à Disneyland Paris, le premier étant lors de son ouverture. J'ai séjourné dans les hôtels Disney et aussi ceux à proximité. Je suis allé à Disneyland Paris deux fois pour Noël et je l'ai vraiment apprécié les deux fois. Ne vous méprenez pas, c'est toujours un bon parc mais commence à montrer son âge. «Grubby» me vient à l'esprit. Partout, il semble que cela pourrait faire avec un bon nettoyage et un smurvey. Les murs et les plinthes dans les restaurants sont éraflés et ont de grandes jonques qui y sont éliminées. La peinture s'écaille dans de nombreux domaines. Je suis allé à Walt Disney World 9 fois et à Disneyland California 3 fois. Tous ces parcs sont impeccables. DLP semble pouvoir faire avec un équipage qui le traverse et le faire nettoyer à nouveau. Tout a un film vert dessus depuis les conditions humides et froides. Nous sommes allés sur le vapeur à palette et les élans en plastique sur la rive de la rivière avaient même le moule vert sur le dos. Pas très convaincant qu'ils sont censés être de vrais animaux. Dans le village de Disney, tous les bâtiments sont également couverts dans ce moule vert et ont des stries sales qui coulent sur le côté des bâtiments. Ce n'est tout simplement pas très «Disney». Les toilettes ont une très mauvaise odeur d'urine lorsque vous y entrez. Les restaurants de restauration rapide ne sont tout simplement pas rapides. Vous attendez dans la file d'attente pour une éternité juste pour prendre un café. À une occasion, la fille qui a pris ma commande a en fait quitté sa station et est allée derrière le comptoir pour obtenir nos cafés parce que même elle était gênée. J'attendais depuis 20 minutes juste pour deux cafés. Casey's à la fin de la rue Main était une blague. Plus d'une heure attendez juste pour obtenir un hot-dog. Venez à Disney Management, triez-le. La qualité de la nourriture est horrible. Vous vous attendez à une restauration rapide dans les parcs à thème, mais au moins il doit être chaud et ne pas être servi des frites détrempées avec du poulet chaud. Surtout lorsque vous êtes facturé beaucoup d'argent pour des déchets. En plus de cela, vous attendez au moins 30 minutes, dans l'un des restaurants, juste pour être servi. Je comprends, c'est une période chargée de l'année mais je n'ai jamais eu à faire la queue depuis si longtemps dans un parc Disney, nous sommes allés pour la fête du Nouvel An qui était OK. Un peu malhonnête de l'entreprise nous disant que le parc serait ouvert jusqu'à 1h du matin parce que beaucoup de manèges que nous avons fermés. Soyez averti que vous paierez 163 pour le laissez-passer de 3 jours et que vous devrez payer 90 supplémentaires juste pour la fête du Nouvel An qui commence à 19 h. Cela implique cependant un gros FAFF à réaliser. Vous utilisez votre billet de jour jusqu'à 17 heures, puis vous devez faire la queue pour obtenir votre bracelet. Achetez votre billet spécial NYE à l'avance comme ils vendent, que vous échangez pour le bracelet. Une fois que vous avez votre bracelet, vous devez quitter le parc à 18h30 à la fermeture. Vous avez ensuite fait la queue à nouveau pour revenir dans le parc en montrant votre bracelet. Vous êtes ensuite recouvert d'une passerelle avec des barrières dans le parc à travers la zone de service où votre bracelet est à nouveau vérifié avant de revenir dans le parc par Hyperspace Mountain. Tout est très chaotique et chaquolique. Je le sais parce que nous avons assisté au très joyeux Noël de Mickey en Floride et c'était fluide et transparent. Ils ont également facturé des frais supplémentaires, mais ce n'était que environ 50. Ils ont fourni du chocolat chaud et des biscuits gratuits inclus dans le prix. Nous pensions que nous pouvons obtenir un verre de champagne gratuit inclus dans le prix du billet, mais ils étaient 10 euros dans des stations spéciales. Avons-nous senti que nous avions un rapport qualité-prix? Non. Bien que les feux d'artifice soient bons, tout le monde s'est assis pendant une heure et demie en attendant qu'ils commencent alors que les files d'attente pour les manèges ouverts étaient de plus d'une heure. Par conséquent, tout le monde a trouvé un siège où le pouvait, ou était assis sur le trottoir dans la rue Main jusqu'à ce qu'il commence. Bien qu'ils soient impressionnants, c'était terminé en 10 minutes. Personnellement, je pense que les «illuminations» à 18 heures étaient bien meilleures. Je dois dire cependant que le défilé était bon. Plus de 35 flotteurs et cela a duré une heure. Le simple fait de regarder les enfants en face de nous l'a rendu spécial. Est-ce que je vais à nouveau à la fête du Nouvel An. Non. J'apprécie que les Français soient très décontractés. Je sais parce que je suis allé au DLP tant de fois. Cependant, je pensais que cette fois, ils étaient encore plus «gaéliques». Les manèges avaient des temps d'attente ridiculement longs quand ils n'avaient pas besoin de l'être. C'était occupé mais j'y suis allé quand il a été plus occupé. Nous arrivions à la fin et voyons qu'ils ne rempliriaient pas les bateaux. Certains étaient à moitié pleins. Je n'ai jamais attendu si longtemps pour la nourriture. La qualité des aliments a certainement empiré. C'est un vrai dommage car le DLP a le potentiel d'être à nouveau un parc incroyable. Si vous visitez Walt Disney World pour la première fois, vous sauverez certainement à nouveau pour aller à Walt Disney World. Apparemment, DLP a un nouveau MD. Il a fait découper son travail. Assez dit. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"

            "Translation error: Soo disappointed in my experience. :( I will preface this review by saying I am a HUGE Disney fan. Coming from the States as a frequent traveler to Walt Disney World and Disneyland in Anaheim, CA, I understand that the bar is set VERY high for Disney parks and attractions. When I first arrived to central Paris, our driver asked what we were doing. When I said our stay concluded with the New Years Eve party and stay onsite in Disneyland Paris, he told me that it was a shame because the parks in the USA are so much better and there are so many things to see and do in France. I laughed it off, but I now realize that he was 100% right. I had done 0 research beforehand as I had gone to Disneyland and Disney Studios several years ago, but my memory is vague. If I recall though, the Studios Park was a bit more fun. If you have a limited time in Paris and if you   ve been to other Disney parks, I   d recommend skipping this one. It does NOT compare to the parks in the states.We paid over $254 USD (over $120 per ticket) to attend the New Years Eve party last night and it was a total disappointment. First and foremost, entering the park was a total mess. The gate agents were totally lazy and allowed people to struggle fumble around with scanning the tickets. In total, it took us 40 minutes just to enter the park, it was an incredibly inefficient system. Unlike the parties or events in the States, nothing special or extra is included  you   re just paying a premium price to get in. The only exception to this is the parade, the parade was a special highlight reel of the best floats of 2018. This is a very nit picky comment but it would have been nice if the parade would have ended with a special float or something commemorating the party or New Years, it just seemed to end abruptly and wasn   t tied together. This was def the best entertainment of the evening  the performers were very enthusiastic. I think it was the only time I saw a smile from cast members all evening! The customer service at this park is absolutely atrocious and unacceptable. This has been a common complaint for years and they   ve done absolutely nothing to address it. 90% of the cast members look miserable at all times, they   re incredibly rude and abrupt, and a good majority stand behind the stores on Main Street chatting laughing while a few diligent workers are actually doing their jobs. It   s entirely mismanaged and poor. Part of the Disney experience is stellar customer service, when I pay a premium price, I expect to at least be treated with basic respect and a smile here and there. Many of the attractions were closed while we were there, and several of the few that were open closed at 10pm, which was unacceptable for the price we paid for the party. Especially since there was only one parade at 8:30, this forced people to choose between rides or the party entertainment. Fantasyland closed two HOURS before the fireworks so I didn   t even have a chance to walk through it. Both Frontier and Adventureland are not lit well at all, very difficult to see at night and very sparse. There isn   t the same attention to detail as there is at the US counterparts, it has really much more of a theme park vibe with the exception of Main Street USA   that is just as magical as any Disney park. Obviously all of the rides that were open had very long lines (otherwise known as queues) which is of course to be expected, it   s one of the busiest times of the year. I did not mind the lines for the rides  it is 100% to be expected. We only got to ride two rides, which was very disappointing but I am not surprised.However, the lines for absolutely everything was not acceptable as it takes away precious time from your day. Fast    casual    restaurants were incredibly inefficient and slow. We waited over 40 minutes for a hot chocolate, which just wasted the precious minimal time that we had during the party. They closed down several restaurants and only had a few open; yet I saw dozens of people SEATED eating their meal on the floor of the fast casual establishments because there was nowhere for them to sit! This is shameful, if you can   t accommodate the ticketed number of guests you need to open more establishments. I   m assuming DLP is severely understaffed. The restrooms were completely disgusting. I   ll spare you the photos, but there was toilet paper strewn about everywhere, a complete mess. You would never see this at WDW or Disneyland Anaheim.The castle illuminations and fireworks were quite good, very magical. The countdown to midnight was a bit underwhelming, the free party at the Village looked more fun.I   ve heard that Disney is going to invest over a billion dollars to make this park better. I certainly hope that is the case. Maybe I will return then. For now, I would not waste your time in Paris if you   ve had the opportunity to experience other Disney parks. If you haven   t been to Disney and don   t foresee a trip to the US anytime soon, I   d recommend going on a non peak day, and certainly not for any ticketed event like New Year   s Eve. I say this through a very critical lens because I travel to Disney parks frequently  IF I lived in Europe and didn   t have the opportunity to travel to the states, I   m sure I would still come to this park and enjoy it for what it is   just would never come back for New Year   s Eve or during any peak seasons, they   re clearly not equipped to handle it well. I am so disappointed after spending $250  for tickets, $330  for an on site hotel, and an exorbitant amount on expenses, that the party was so lackluster. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"

            "Translation error: C'était donc début octobre, le temps commençait à passer de tropical à froid, sombre et déprimant. Nous avons eu un excellent été et pour nous éloigner des météo Blues, ma femme et moi avons décidé de faire un voyage à Disneyland Paris pour les vacances à mi-parcours pour enfants vers la dernière semaine d'octobre. Ce qui est intéressant, c'est que nous avons décidé de faire un road trip en Europe pendant toute la semaine au dos de cette idée. Je n'entrerai pas dans les détails de l'autre partie du voyage et je me concentrerai sur Disneyland lui-même. Je m'excuse! J'adore raconter une histoire! Plus de critiques à venir pour les autres parties du voyage. Les prix étaient raisonnables pour les billets de parc 2 jours 2 (450 pour 2 adultes et 2 enfants âgés de 5 et 6 ans). Nous y avons conduit et sommes restés dans un appartement à proximité (je vais le passer en revue séparément). Les premières impressions étaient bonnes. Le parc est bien entretenu par les navettes des hôtels voisins. L'endroit est globalement très propre. Le personnel (acteurs) va au-delà pour vous servir avec la plus grande attention et soins. Tous les personnages que nous avons rencontrés dans les deux parcs étaient constamment de caractère et souriants. Ma seule réservation est que l'endroit pourrait faire avec plus de toilettes. Ou peut-être avoir plus de signalisation pointant vers les toilettes. La plupart des travailleurs sont très propres à l'exception de quelques-uns. Mon deuxième scrupule avec ce voyage était que vous ne pouvez pas simplement faire la queue et rencontrer des personnages. Vous devez télécharger une application (lineberty) et un pré-livre. Le problème est que les réservations pour divers personnages dans les deux parcs ouvertes à 9h45 le jour où vous souhaitez rencontrer un personnage et lorsque nous (ma femme et moi) avons essayé de vous connecter pour réserver des compétitions de personnages pour mon fils et ma fille, l'application nous a continué à nous dire que nous étions trop loin de Disneyland Paris pour réserver une rencontre. Gardez à l'esprit que nous étions à moins de 2 km. Nous avons décidé d'aller au parc et de réserver et l'application a montré que nous étions dans le parc, mais nous sommes toujours venus nous disant que nous étions trop loin (250 mètres !!!!!) C'était très frustrant et ennuyeux parce que les personnages préférés de mes filles étaient possibles à se rencontrer en faisant la queue à Princess Pavilion, mais des personnages comme Woody de Toy Story, Mickey Mouse et Sully de Monsters Inc ont dû être réservés via l'application. Et nous n'avons pas pu le faire. J'aurais même payé un supplément pour que mon fils rencontre Woody (son personnage préféré de tous les temps pour le moment!). Mais il n'a jamais pu vivre cela. L'autre problème que nous avons eu était les temps de file d'attente. Nous avons réservé des billets Fast Pass pour éviter d'avoir à faire la queue dans la mesure du possible, mais il semble que 80 à 90% des manèges et ou des attractions que nous voulions expérimenter n'offraient pas de voie rapide et que nous devions faire la queue. Ma fille voulait vraiment voir Rapunzel comme son personnage préféré. Ariel a donc été le premier à 10h00 le jour donné avec Rapunzel immédiatement après 15h00. Nous avons fait la queue pendant près de 2 heures pour rencontrer Ariel (qui était charmant pour les enfants et a rendu ma fille très heureuse). Cependant, au moment où nous sommes sortis, nous nous sommes renseignés sur Raiponce et on nous a dit que nous devions faire la queue immédiatement pour rencontrer Rapunzel. Ce qui aurait signifié 4 heures au total de la file d'attente pour rencontrer 2 princesses! Mes enfants ont été brisés à ce stade et nous ne pouvions pas supporter de reprendre la file d'attente à nouveau. Puisque mon fils n'a pu rencontrer aucun de ses personnages préférés et que je n'ai pas pu payer. J'ai lu sur un autre forum en ligne que vous pouvez réserver un repas dans l'un des restaurants du parc (Cinderellas Auberge de Cendrillon) et il y a plusieurs princesses et autres personnages qui rencontreront et salueront les invités pendant leur repas. Le coût était relativement élevé et c'est l'un des déjeuners les plus chers que j'ai eu depuis le déjeuner au Ritz il y a quelques années. Je pense que le projet de loi au total était d'environ 250. Maintenant, nous avons rencontré 4 personnages principaux Disney (Cendrillon, Aurora, Merida et Blanche-Neige avec les aides de souris de Cendrillon). Les enfants étaient sur la lune en rencontrant les personnages, en particulier ma fille, mais je pense que c'était toujours un peu incomplet car elle n'a jamais pu rencontrer Rapunzel car elle aime me le rappeler! Néanmoins, elle a eu beaucoup plus qu'elle n'aurait pu négocier et était beaucoup plus chanceuse que son frère cadet qui n'a pas pu rencontrer et saluer l'un de ses personnages préférés en raison de la pauvre application. A part ça, tout le reste était vraiment bon. Les manèges étaient fantastiques, la nourriture était bonne (bien que coûteuse), les parcs étaient généralement très propres, les défilés sont excellents, les personnages et le personnel excellents, les affichages des feux d'artifice à 22h00 sont excellents (bien que je suggère de trouver un bon point de vue plus tôt) et généralement l'endroit a une sensation magique en prenant un homme de 32 ans qui n'a pas un grand intérêt à Disney. Le personnel parle tous anglais et j'ai également remarqué que l'espagnol et l'allemand étaient également parlés par la plupart des membres du personnel. Excellent tout autour. Je ne peux pas le comparer à Walt Disney World comme je ne l'ai jamais été, mais pour ce que c'est, c'est bien! --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"

            "Translation error: Since many years I read a lot about this place in Paris but mainly negative news through newspapers, forums and one of the US colleagues, thus I didn   t have great hopes visiting this place.But my wife had clean slate about this place and she wanted to visit    The Happiest Place on Earth    & after 2 days we did have happiest time on earth Here are tons of tips to make your trip memorable    There are 2 parks which you can visit in 2 days namely Disneyland Park ( 10:00     23:30 ) & Walt Disney Studios ( 10:00     19:00 )     1 day is NOT enough to cover both parks, you will miss many interesting rides. We recommend minimum 2 days    As you   re spending good amount of money for park, stretch a bit more to enjoy 2nd day as well.    After validating ticket, do NOT forget to pick up 2 pamplates namely Park Layout Plan & Programme Plan    Most annoying thing for me was waiting for ride for 45 minutes and it gets over in 30 sec to 2 minutes     We   ve created 6 categories to plan your day days to have memorable experiences as below 1   6 . Travel    If you   re staying in Paris then catch RER A4 which takes 45     55 minutes from Chatelet Les Halles station.    Ask for schedule on major stations before riding and also buy round tickets upfront to avoid night time rush at Marne la Vallee station ( next to Disneyland park )    Atleast reach by 09:30 at Disneyland, earlier is better as well to take pictures when there is less crowd 2   6 . Stay    If you   ve loads of money then definitely stay in Disneyland hotel inside Park itself. This can be really amazing experience    We had stayed in Paris and took RER train to travel or some prefer to stay in hotels nearby Park but we found them costly as well during June     Sept months3   6 . Park Tickets     Thanks to my wife, I took super wise decision to buy tickets for 2 days     We bought 2 separate tickets ( 1 Day   2 Parks ) 68 Euro per person   per day     We could do only 50%     60% of Disneyland on Day 1 so first day ticket didn   t get fully utilized     On 2nd day we spend morning to noon 60     70% of time in    Walt Disney Studio    and remaining time till 23:30 in    Disneyland    doing remaining rides from Day 1 and light   fireworks show at 23:00     Do NOT buy 2 day ticket but 2 separate tickets for 1 Day either 1 Park   2 Parks per your plan.     Buy tickets online in advance; as it   s costly to buy at Park and wasting precious time standing in queue4   6 . Food, Drink    There is nice & cold drinking water taps outside toilets ( Disneyland, Walt Disney Studio ). Don   t forget to carry your own water bottle    Food is costly and doesn   t have variety.     There are some really nice Ice cream shops which sell 3 big scoops for 5 Euros, you should definitely try those.    You can carry your own food, so carry dry fruits, fruits, sandwiches to keep energy level up till 23:005   6 . Rides ( Must Try, Good, Average )     Not all rides have Fast Pass ( time slot in which you can come back later, this has queue as well but shorter one )     Collect as many Fast Passes possible in morning time itself     Waiting time display is approximate, you can easily add 20% more to it     Do NOT spend all your time in rides but also watching live shows    Keep some rides for evening slot say after 16:00 as majority of the crowd will be tired and you will lesser waiting time    Some rides has got    Single Rider    option where you need to ride alone with strangers and can   t do with your family   partner. This option as well saves lots of waiting time.    Note that not all rides in Disneyland works till late evening, so check for individual ride   s timing. Strangely it   s not mentioned in pamphlet    Note that some of the rides will be closed for maintenance    For light & fireworks capture your seats at 21:00 itself, better sit in back of Central Plaza.

            "Translation error: Hi allHaving just returned from DLP I thought it might be useful to write a short idiots guide with some of the info I wish I'd known before I went.Firstly   getting there. We drove (going through the chunnel) so if you're flying we can't help you with this bit. Our Satnav got us there no problem and most people will have some form of access to a satnav these days. There are signs to DLP but they are few and far between so don't rely on them to guide you there. There is also a very good guide that we used to get us there. It's here under post number 9: https:  www.tripadvisor.co.uk ShowTopic g226865 i2224 k5776128 Driving to DLP and advise please Marne la Vallee Seine et Marne Ile de France.htmlBe aware of the advice about 3 4 of the way down where you need to be in the fast lane to get to the right road   this is easy to miss and the French tend to drive nose to tail so changing lanes can be traumatic! There are guides to avoiding the toll on the A1 but, given what you're spending on the rest of the trip, I'd say it's not worth the hassle   it cost us   22 each way (yep, it's expensive).It goes without saying that you need the extra kit to drive on the French roads but these are readily available at Halfords and other car placesDAVEY CROCKETT RANCHWe stayed at the Davey Crockett ranch which, for us, turned out to be an excellent choice. I'll go over why that was in a moment.The ranch itself was perfect for our needs (be aware they wont let you in until 4pm on the day of arrival). We're 2 adults with a 6 and 9 year old. There were 2 separate rooms with an internal area which had a freezer, fridge, dishwasher, tv but no oven.The reason we went with Davey Crockett was the self catering option. We researched the meal plans beforehand and we thought they were really expensive   we also preferred to cook our own food as lots of the food on site was 'junk' food (chips burgers etc). Not saying that we don't like that but it's good to have a real meal in the day as well. The park states that there's to be no 'pique nique' in the grounds but everyone does it and they don't seem to stop anyone. This is a MAJOR benefit as the prices for food within the park are exorbitant (about   8 for a hotdog and chips etc). This may sound like we're being tight and grumpy but trust me   once you're in the queue for that   8 burger you'll be wincing too   we were very happy with our baguettes which we took with us each morning. Getting food: If you have room I'd recommend taking a lot of sundries with you if you're staying in Davey Crockett. Although reception gives you a guide to finding the big supermarket (Auchan) actually finding it for the first time (before you get familiar with the local roads) can be quite stressful. Again, your Satnav may guide you there no problem but it's worth having a meal ready to go on the first day to avoid trauma. Auchan itself is very well provisioned and has everything you'd need for your trip. We stocked up for the week in 1 shop and never had to go back.But what about the bread? Well there's the 'Park Natural' which is open to Davey Crockett ranch users whilst the pool is being renovated and that contains a great Boulangerie where we picked up our bread for the remainder of the trip. The advantage of this was it was just around the corner from the ranches and therefore much easier to find that Auchan.DISNEY HOTEL OR NOT DISNEY HOTELOK, so we can't comment on the other hotels and you know how we felt about our own. The main and overwhelming reason why you should go for a Disney hotel is the access to magic hour which is super super important to getting the most out of the parks. Basically you get access to the park from 08:30 when the general public get access from 10:00. This time is utterly precious for getting access to characters and the popular rides. If you're smart you can whizz through a lot of the rides that you'd spend hours queueing for later on within this time. Also, your kids are going to want to have their autograph books signed and this is by far the best time to do this (queues for the popular characters can easily be 2 hours plus once the park opens to the general public).AUTOGRAPH HUNTINGWhilst I'm on the subject   if you're looking for one of the princess autographs here's what you should do. Plan to be one of the first at the gate at 08:30 (which probably means getting there at 08:15 or so). Know where the princess meeting booth is (so you might want to do this on the first day and actually get the autograph on the second). Once the gate is opened leg it as fast as you can to the booth (you wont be the only one!!) and get as far up the queue as you can. We didn't do this ('cos we didn't know) and ended up spending from 08:30 to 11:00 in the queue (and you don't get to know which princess it's going to be!). There's precious little to see whilst you're queueing so make sure you have something to keep your little ones amused!There's also a trick to seeing Mickey. He's got his own special house in the main park where you can greet him which usually has brutal queues but he also appears in the Studio park in the morning (next to Aladdin's carpet ride). We only had to wait 30 mins to see him here. So if you manage to time it right this can be a great time saver.THE CASTLE LIGHT UP EVENING SHOWDo this once. Seriously. It is worth seeing but the crowds are huge and getting out afterwards takes forever. Make sure you have good hold on young children and have a contingency plan for getting separated (even for them   the main bandstand for example). We did it mid week, I'd hate to think what it was like on a Saturday. Also, don't worry so much about getting prime position. We were somewhat to the side but still got to see everything and the castle was spectacular.THE RIDESThis is something I wish we'd known before we got there as, if your time is limited, there's definitely some which you should prioritise. We were there for 4 days and it was only by day 4 that we had fully covered both parks.Here's a quick guide to some of the rides and what we thought of them (this is clearly subjective but I'll try to be as open as possible)I'll also only name rides you can't see inside.HYPERSPACE MOUNTAINThis is a full on rollercoaster in the dark with flashing light effects. The height limit is 1.2m but I'd urge caution in letting young children onto this (my daughter is just under 1.2m and I'm very glad she wasn't allowed on   she'd have been terrified). It's easily the most intense ride in the park so if you're looking for thrills   that's the one to go for.SPACE TOURSThis is a great family ride. Basically it's a simulator but it's very well done and suitable for all ages   my 6 year old loved it and she's never seen Star Wars!BUZZ LIGHYEARBasically you're on a track and you shoot targets using a light gun. It was alright but we went on when there was no queue and we didn't go on it again for the remainder of our stay.IT'S A SMALL WORLD AFTER ALLA boat ride through the countries of the world with dolls decked out in national gear. My kids loved it and it's fun for the parents to see the rather patronising view of each country. Its queue also moves really fast so it's worth doing for that alone. As an aside if you've ever played Portal 2 look up at the ceiling whilst you're on the ride   you'll get what I mean...PETER PANA great ride, well worth the queue time. You fly over London and Neverland. It's one of those rides that does a great job of making you feel you're part of a story   especially when you're flying through the stars.PINOCCHIO and SNOW WHITEBasically train rides with models at the side telling the story of the character. Could be scary for very young children. Not worth a huge wait.PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEANArgh! (not in a piratey way). The queue for this was an abomination and is longer than the ride itself. Only go on this one at off peak times. The ride itself is amazingly well done and keeps your attention but we only went on it once as we just couldn't face that queue again! It's suitable for everyone.INDIANA JONESA great fun rollercoaster with a 360 loop. This was one of my eldest daughter's (9) favourites. It's exciting but not terrifying. Again, this is one of the ones you can get onto multiple times if you go off peak.BIG THUNDER MOUNTAINThis was our family favourite rollercoaster. It has a brilliant mix of thrills and character (the ending was exhilarating each time even though you knew it was coming). This was my youngest daughter's (6) favourite ride in the park. The queues can be big so it's worth fast passing this one.STUDIOS PARK RIDESThis park shuts at 7 so you should plan for this when considering what rides to go on. If you time it right you can get on a lot of rides as the park tends to empty towards 7 as people migrate into the other park   we got on a lot of rides quickly this way.AEROSMITH COASTERFast, noisy and jarring. LIke Hyperspace mountain but not so much fun. Not suitable for young children and certainly not worth queueing for hours for. If I went again I'd skip this altogether.HAUNTED HOUSE and CRUSH COASTERThese were both shut for our visit so I can't commentTOWER OF TERRORAgain, we caught this at zero queue time. It's essentially a jumping bean style ride which takes you up and then drops you down. It's very well put together and is the best one of these type of rides I've been on   The ride itself contains ghostly images which may be scary and unsettling for young children (my 9 year old didn't like this at all)MICKEY'S MAGIQUE SHOWTotally worth it. It's a live 1 2 hour show that takes in lots of Disney favourites such as The Lion King and Frozen. It's a bit like seeing 6 West End shows in 1 2 an hour. It says on the guide that you should get there 20 minutes before but it's more like 40   we got there then and we were one of the last ones let in. It doesn't matter where you sit in the theatre (but the way some patrons acted in order to get seats tells you a lot about how people can lose themselves in certain circumstances). We were at the back and had a great time. ARMAGEDDON SPECIAL EFFECTSEssentially a long winded affair where you end up being in a circular room where things explode and flames shoot out of the ceiling. OK but not worth queueing for hours for.TRAM TOURGood fun. You get taken to a 'back lot' set for a movie where you see lots of special effects. I wont spoil it by telling you what but it's very impressive (but only really worth doing once)RATATOUILLE By far and away my favourite ride of all the rides at both parks. It puts you in the place of a rat in a restaurant and does a great job of really making you feel tiny   we did this one 3 times. The queues can get big but it does move quickly. It's not at all scary and a great family ride.FAST PASS   How best to use itFast Pass is an excellent system. Basically you use your ticket to scan a fast pass booth next to the ride and this gives you a time slot to come back at. You then return at this time and get on the ride within 5 minutes as you take a different queue. Be aware that fast pass can sell out very quickly for the popular rides so it's worth planning getting these tickets into your day. We used it to get repeat rides on our favourites. It makes you feel great moving past all the queues (equally you look enviously on Fast Passers when you're in the real queue!).PARK EXHAUSTIONOK. This is really worth considering. My wife's fitbit registered us as clocking up about 20k in an average day. This is a lot (especially for little ones) so you should consider breaking your day accordingly.Because of the magic hour we always arrived at 08:30 but then bailed at around 14:00 when the park became mega busy. If you're in Davey Crockett and still have access to Park Natural go swimming at the aqua centre. This worked out brilliantly for us as it gave the kids a break and got us off our feet. We then had an early dinner and returned to the park for about 18:00 when many day visitors and coaches were leaving.I guess if you're in one of the catered hotels you could do the same with the hotel pool (but I can't comment as I wasn't there).Apart from the night where we saw the castle illuminations we would then leave at about 21:00 as this allowed us to avoid the big queues.FINAL THOUGHTSWas it worth it? Totally. Yes, it's really expensive but our kids had the time of their lives and I took memories back that will stay with me forever. The parks are beautifully maintained and I can't say I had a really negative thing to say about them. We came on Monday and left on Saturday. We had 3 hours in the park on Saturday morning and it was clearly much much busier than mid week (to the point where it was hard to negotiate the number of people around you). So if you've not booked yet it'd be worthwhile avoiding the weekend if at all possible.Oh, and next time   we'll book the Sleeping Beauty suite at the main hotel   it overlooks the main street in the park and has a grand piano   the site doesn't even give you a price for it (you have to phone). I guess I'll get saving now : )I've probably missed lots of stuff but I'm sure you can pick that up from other posts.Hope your trip will be as good as ours! --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"

            "Translation error: Fitulations d'une heure: pour la majorité des manèges, il y a eu une longue file d'attente (parfois encore plus).   Pour vos clients qui ne restent à Disneyland que pendant un jour ou deux, c'est un gros problème car cela signifie que nous avons moins de temps pour profiter pleinement de Disneyland. FastPass: C'est particulièrement frustrant lorsqu'il est pratiquement impossible d'utiliser le FastPass. Vous deviez arriver à la balade que vous vouliez d'abord pour réserver tout à l'avance plutôt que de simplement faire la queue dans la voie Fastpass comme vous le feriez dans n'importe quel autre parc à thème (pourquoi iriez-vous à un tour, puis repartez et reviendriez-vous?). Bien qu'il soit apparu très tôt, toutes les manèges ont été réservés trop rapidement au moment où nous les sommes arrivés, nous n'avons donc pas pu l'utiliser même une fois! Des heures magiques et des difficultés techniques: les points ci-dessus ont à peu près ruiné notre premier jour à Disneyland, mais nous avions des espoirs pour la matinée avec les heures magiques qui nous ont été promis dans notre forfait. On nous a dit que cela obtient 2 heures supplémentaires dans le parc avant qu'elle ne devienne ouverte au public, cependant, notre réceptionniste hôtelière nous a informés que ce n'était en fait que 1 heure 30 minutes. Chaque minute compte à Disneyland et j'attendais de me rendre à Disneyland toute ma vie, mais nous l'avons laissé glisser ... Nous nous dirigeons vers les manèges qui sont censés être ouverts à ce moment: Rock 'n' Roller et Ratatouille, mais les deux sont confrontés à des difficultés techniques et ne s'attendaient pas à être ouverts avant 10h du matin, par coïncidence, le temps d'ouverture normal du parc. À ce stade, nous nous sentons assez contrariés, car nous savons que dès que le parc s'ouvre officiellement, il y aura à nouveau des files d'attente d'une heure pour des manèges qui durent un maximum de 7 minutes et une moyenne de moins d'une minute. Mais alors que nous faisons notre chemin dans le parc, à 9h30, nous tombons sur une file d'attente raisonnablement longue pour les pirates des Caraïbes, qui devraient ouvrir en 30 minutes. Nous décidons de faire la queue alors qu'il est court et espérons un haut de file d'attente de 40 minutes (étant donné qu'il ne s'ouvre pas avant 10h de toute façon). Après 35 minutes de file d'attente de la file d'attente devant nous, commencez à se disperser au hasard. Nous allons demander à un membre du personnel à l'avant ce qui s'est passé et la réponse? Difficultés techniques encore. Nous nous précipitons dans le train du parc dans l'espoir que nous n'avons pas manqué nos dernières chances d'entrer dans une file d'attente plus courte avant que la foule ne sorte en force, mais bien sûr, elles l'ont déjà fait. Nous le suçons, acceptons notre sort et attendons ... un train arrive. Il est assez bondé mais il y a quelques espaces ici et là. Ils pourraient probablement prendre environ un quart de notre file d'attente. Faux. Le personnel de Disney n'a même pas ouvert la porte pour que nous puissions s'aligner à chaque voiture et avant de le savoir, le train part. Personne de notre file d'attente n'était monté à bord. Meilleure chance dans le prochain train. Une autre file d'attente d'une heure dans le froid glacial. Food: Table Service Restaurants: Mais vous n'avez pas de réservation? Désolé, il ne nous reste plus de tables.  Comment pouvez-vous ne pas sensibiliser à cela? Si j'avais été informé de cela au moment de la réservation, j'aurais même fait un dépôt si j'avais su à quel point il était difficile d'obtenir simplement de la nourriture. Il n'y a pas d'option de réserver en ligne de tout ce que vous avez littéralement à vous rendre au restaurant lui-même pour faire une réservation Comment les visiteurs les premier? Après avoir été refoulé par tous vos restaurants de service de table, nous avons essayé de commander n'importe quoi dans un restaurant de restauration rapide en libre-service, avec des files d'attente aussi longtemps qu'ils l'ont été pour les attractions et avec nulle part si vous vous êtes assis à l'extérieur ... inconnu. Personnages de Disney: Nous n'avons repéré que 4 personnages tout le temps que nous étions là n'incluons pas les défilés qui ne comptent pas vraiment car je ne pouvais pas les voir, étant juste à l'arrière de la foule qui a commencé à se former environ une heure avant le début du défilé, ce qui rend impossible de faire quoi que ce soit, vraiment ... comme avec tout ce qu'une photo prend une heure de longueur. Dans l'ensemble, cela n'avait vraiment pas l'impression que c'était Disneyland. Cela ressemblait plus à un parc à thème général ou même à un pop-up funfair pendant le demi-trimestre, la seule exception étant les illuminations Disney. Après s'être plaint à Disneyland, ils nous ont offert des billets de parc gratuits, ce qui est une blague absolue car je ne reviendrais pas pour revivre ce qui précède s'ils me payaient. Lorsque nous avons refusé les billets de parc gratuits, ils ne nous ont même pas remboursé le prix d'un billet de parc adulte, 2 jours 2. Money Money est tout ce dont ils se soucient. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"

            "Translation error: Disneyland World   a place that is world renowned for delivering plenty of Disney fun. So how does its European equivalent in the land of liberty, equality and fraternity compare to the original in the land of opportunity? A recent visit enabled an interesting comparison, and the score card is not promising:1. Disneyland park and rides: how did my favourite rides match up to their counterparts in the U.S.? Not easy to ascertain... pirates of the Caribbean   closed for repair; A small world : closed for refurbishment ; space mountain (or rather their exciting new ride Hyperspace Mountain)   sounded promising given the screaming going on while we were waiting in the queue, however the ride broke down for the 2nd time that day 20 mins into our wait   so we were told to come back later.... At least the Haunted Manor did not disappoint (and was open, which was a bonus). 3 out of 4 of our favourite rides open   strike 1.2. Fastpass    Board within a matter of minutes  is how this service is described on the eurodisney website. The waiting time for our ride was 50 mins, so we showed up with our fastpass tickets at the allotted time and were in the queue for 40 mins... define  fast . Strike 2.3. Food and drink in the park   many reviews are already out there complaining about the   6 drinks and   10 sandwiches, so we won't repeat the overstated; let us instead focus on where you can consume these overpriced items. We were lucky enough to visit Eurodisney in brilliant weather and noticed several nice spots where we could sit down with our drinks and which were surprisingly empty   mystery solved: we tried to bring food and drink to the outdoor tables only to be told that food and drink were only sold to be consumed in the dark rooms that were the indoor dining spaces. Perfect on a cold winters day   not so good when wanting to take advantage of the sunshine. Strike 3.4. Disney hotels. My husband was there for a conference so my daughter and I tagged along for 2 nights. The New York hotel was our appointed hotel and as such a special check in lane has been designated for the members of this conference   but just the one lane out of 6 in the check in area. With more conference participants lining up to check in at the time we arrived than there were regular guests, the check in process was long and arduous as just one person was there to check everyone in and hand them their welcome packs. Some welcome. Strike 4.5. The room: more specifically cleaning thereof. I could say that I cannot comment as during our 2 night stay we saw no evidence of cleaning and did not see the maid once. No wait   we did see the trolleys in various parts of the corridors, however our room did not get made up. Granted, on the first day we did not leave the room until after 10am   this had never been a problem in other hotels so the next day we tried a different approach   leaving the hotel room earlier. Sadly this was no more effective and we returned yet again to a room of unmade beds and damp towels. The problem might be the  do not disturb  sign which is left on the door as we spent half an hour in the room after breakfast getting ready to visit the sights. On the third day with the conference being in full swing, my husband was out of the room by 8am. He returned to the room at noon for a shower and change of clothes (by which time the room still had not been done) and at that time put on the do not disturb sign... the maid fairies had obviously been lying in wait, as they chose that precise hour, noon to 1pm, to pounce and attempt to clean the room. They changed back into pumpkins at precisely 1.01 pm, so unfortunately he managed to notch up yet another day of no bedding or towel change. A call to reception revealed that there is no set time for the maid to pass, but once she has done your area that is it   she will not return that same day. No clean towels nor made up beds for 3 nights. Strike 5.6. The bathroom: the New York hotel is themed, as the name indicates, after the big apple. Pictures of skyscrapers adorn the rooms and halls, and in the bathroom a rather worn looking shower curtain is emblazoned with the NY Mets logo. Now while I do enjoy a good baseball game, if I want to see their emblem on my skin a tattoo might be an option   rather than the feeling of a cold wet shower curtain sticking to you (as well as every other previous users) while you shower. Haven't shower curtains been replaced with glass partitions in most good hotels? Strike 6.7. On the subject of bathrooms, I was eager to try out the ubiquitous array of free toiletries which are usually on offer in good hotels. But wait   there were none. Just a Mickey Mouse themed bottle of body lotion. Why only body lotion I wonder... does the stay leave you with dry body skin as well as frayed nerves... or does the shower curtain annoy patrons so much that they do not stay long enough to wash their hair? To make matters worse, on the before last day (when the room was finally visited by the cleaner) our handy travel size Bulgary soap (brought along especially for when hotel room soaps run out and are not replaced...) vanished from the bathroom. God giveth   and God taketh away... Strike 7.8. The hotel bars: we tried 2 different hotels in the resort and in both places you need to make sure that you have plenty of time set aside to enjoy the experience and that you polish off your dance moves as  wave your hands in the air like you don't care  is the only way you will get served. Still unsure as to what topic of conversation behind the bar kept the bar staff so enthralled, but at least we got an upper body workout.. strike 8.9. Minibar   do not make the mistake we did by removing anything from the fridge   they are automatically charged to your room within seconds of being removed from their sensor pads. Like Indiana Jones in the famous scene from raiders of the lost ark, we removed a drink from the fridge to take a closer look at what kind of water was being charged at   4 a bottle, but unlike Indy we did not had a bag of sand of equal weight to quickly replace on the sensor pad, and a call to reception confirmed that we had been charged for the item(s) removed. With no free bottles of water laid on for guests in the room like so many hotels do, Indiana Jones' worn water gourd looked better and better... Strike 9.It is however not all doom and gloom   unlike the maid service, the minibar checkers come to the room daily, without fail, to tally up and replace as need be any overpriced beverages that have been consumed. A call to reception to request clean towels is swiftly followed though with a member of staff bringing these to the room within 10 minutes. They did not enquire as to why we needed these so I assume that the lack of maid service means that requests for clean towels occurs on a regular basis. And finally, when the hotel restaurant is unavailable to guests as it has been booked out for various functions, they are quick to recommend and book other restaurants in the resort   with main courses starting at no less than   25....The only people having fun at Disneyland Paris these days are the ones sitting behind the tills.... If you can't say something nice, say nothin' at all... . Sorry Bambi. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"

            "Translation error: Je n'avais jamais été aussi excité d'aller à Disneyland pour la première fois, mais notre expérience était quelque peu différente de la façon dont j'imaginais. Le parc est beau et enchanteur, c'est vrai, mais la disposition est déroutante et les files d'attente sont ridicules. Bien sûr, c'est ce que nous attendions d'avoir visité Disneyworld Orlando, mais par rapport à là-bas, Disneyland ne le coupe tout simplement pas. Nous avons fait la queue pendant 3 heures au Princess Pavilion, pas tout à fait sûr de ce qu'il était réellement, nous avons pensé que cela devait être quelque chose d'incroyable pour toute cette traction et cette file d'attente. Mais non, c'était une rencontre avec une princesse qui a pris les 30 secondes, nous avons été tellement déçus que nous avions perdu tant de temps à attendre (bien que cela nous ait pris hors de la pluie!). Nous avons rejoint plusieurs files d'attente pour les personnages pour signer le livre d'autographes et obtenir une photo, mais nous nous sommes détournés du personnel presque à chaque fois qui ont dit que la file d'attente était maintenant fermée, les enfants étaient bouleversés et sont repartis avec seulement 2 signatures de toute la journée. Les stands de nourriture fermés tôt aussi !! Nous pensons que nous aurions peut-être manqué une section entière du parc en raison du manque de publication de panneaux.

            "Translation error: I was recently made redundant from my job of 15 years. I have 2 daughters aged 24 and 21 and we are huge Disney fans. We have visited Orlando on a few occasions when they were younger. I decided that I would use some of my redundancy money to fund a Disney trip as a treat. I could not afford Orlando so we booked a trip to Disneyland Paris and the three of us were very excited about it. The trip was a catastrophic disappointment. We stayed at the New York Hotel which was lovely   no real complaints there. We were offered the free meal plan which I upgraded to the Plus Plan.We arrived on Tuesday 28th June quite late and decided we would go into Disney Village for our evening meal. We decided to use our vouchers at Annette's. Whilst the food was lovely the service was unacceptable. We were served by a young waiter who advised us what we could order from the menu. I explained that I am vegetarian and so he said I could have the Veggie Burger, I asked if if was possible to change the toppings on the burger, the response was  no . Nothing else, just  no . We ordered drinks and I ordered a lemon fanta. Again the response was  you can't have that on your meal plan . I was very taken aback as this is not the kind of service I expect when in Disney. The food was lovely but the service left me feeling like I was a pauper expecting welfare handouts. It sullied the whole meal. I would have been prepared to pay for anything extra we wanted but that clearly was not an option.Nevermind, we thought, tomorrow is another day. We'll have fun in Disney Studios. How wrong we were. We arrived at the park at 11.30am, attempted to get into a Cinemagique and Art of Animation experience to be told to come back at 12 o clock. We then moved onto and spent the first half an hour queueing to get into the Armageddon  ride . It was absolutely rubbish. We couldn't understand a word that was being said and had expected so much more based on our Orlando experience. The day then goes from bad to worse. We next went to the Rock n Roller Coaster and expected to queue for one hour according to the notices. However, the ride broke down and so it was more like 2 hours that we queued. We next went to the  Behind the Scenes  tram experience and queued up for 20 minutes to then be told to go away as the ride had broken down. We were feeling very despondent and let down by this time. We moved around to Crush's coaster and queued up for half an hour to be told again that the ride had broken down and to go away and come back later. We decided to go into the Toy Story section of the park. More disappointment when we realised the Indy Car ride was closed for refurbishment. Never mind we thought, we'll go on the Parashute Drop. Can you guess what happened? After 45 minutes of queueing we were told that the ride had broken down and to come back later. By now this had totally ruined our day. We decided to try Crush again and after one and half hours of queuing we managed to get on the ride. Earlier in the day, around 3 o clock we had tried to get a fastpass for Ratatouille as the queue time was 2 hours but even though the park had 4 hours before it closed there were no fast passes available. So we spent nearly 8 hours in Disney Studios and only managed to get on 3 rides. Not exactly Disney standards or our money's worth.We were still unsure about the meal plan after our experience at Annette's and so decided to pay for a meal at Planet Hollywood instead that evening to cheer ourselves up.The next day we went into Disneyland Park with hopes that we might have a good day. We queued for 45 minutes for Buzz Lightyear (the wait time said 15 minutes). My girls were excited for some of the bigger rides and so we raced over to Space Mountain: closed. More disappointment. We raced over to Star Tours: closed. It goes on: Casey Jr: closed. Big Thunder Mountain: closed. Pirate Galleon: closed. Robinson Tree House: Closed. Peter Pan: Closed. Riverboat landing: closed. What a huge disappointment. We spent 12 hours in the park and the only rides we managed to get on were Indiana Jones after a horrific queue (no wonder as no other thrill rides were open) and Pirates of the Caribbean. We tried to get a fastpass for Indiana Jones at 2pm and bearing in mind that the rides didn't close til 10 that evening there were none left!We also ate in Blue Lagoon and I ordered the only vegetarian dish available and it came in a fish sauce so couldn't eat it.The whole trip was a huge disappointment from start to finish. Well over 50% of the big thrill rides were closed and added to that the number of rides that broke down we only managed a measly 5 rides after spending a total of 20 hours in the parks.This trip was meant to be a memory making trip for my daughters and I and it made all the wrong sort of memories. I don't think a review can fully get across the true disappoinment of the trip.I feel that my money has been taken under false promises. We booked with the intention of getting a Disney experience. Blackpool Pleasure Beach would have done better.I wrote to the CEO a week ago and havent even received an acknowledgement. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"

            "Translation error: Where do I even begin? I joined this site specifically to write this review. And Ive been thinking of what to write throughout the holiday. We went in half term, 15 19 feb 16. This was our second visit as a Family. We went last March but in term time and loved it, but felt we didnt get everything done so booked it again. We stayed in the hotel Cheyenne.To make this review make more sense, I need to say last year we loved it. It was amazing and we hadnt stopped thinking of going back since. Almost everyday it crossed my mind. Also we have two Children, at the time of the most recent visit the boys 3 almost 4, the girls 7 almost 8. Disneyland Paris is an unusual place and very hard to make a review of. There were times this week where I could have given it a 1 star rating, and times where 5 stars wouldnt be enough. Our first day there, Monday was ok, we got a lot done. it became apparent how busy it was compared to last year by the huge amount of people watching the parade. There are grown men and women out there that will push infront of very young children to watch characters in costume dance past! Shocking. But not disneys fault. Breakfast on Tuesday morning in the hotel Cheyenne was one of the most frustrating experiences Ive had recently. We had to sit in the bar squashed up the corner. It was then I noticed the Brits had taken over the place and it was like mcdonalds on a saturday afternoon. Pushing shoving swearing etc all for people to some breakfast. I also noticed (and had noticed Monday night) there were students everywhere. Not just a few, hundreds. The vast majority were golden but a few were horrible, noisy, running up and down the corridors of the hotel at 11pm etc. It was like this all week. Again not disneys fault as such.Wednesday was the worse day in the park. I hear the French have wednesdays off work? It would make sense. There was a point in the day, late morning iirc, where we couldnt do anything. We couldnt go on any rides (we were in studios at the time) they were an hour min. Ratoutoullie was a 180 min wait! You could barely walk around, ques to ride, eat, go to the toilet. The kids started getting really fed up as did we. It was at that point id wondered why I spent close to 2 grand on a holiday where we couldnt do anything. Despite that, come the end of the day we still managed to get a lot done. Although it was busy there were still shows and other rides in the other park we managed to get a lot done. Big bit of advice when its this busy is to book a table! We forgot for weds and ended up eating at 21:15pm. The year before there was never any need to book.We did cafe mickey and I cant reccomend this enough. The food is good, very tasty but nothing special. But you dont go for the food! You get to meet lots of charachters and they spend a bit of time with you too. Me and the wife said to eachother that this also saved us needing to que up in the part to meet charachters. Loved it. We also ate with the Princesses on Thursday. For   170 I wouldnt reccomend it. It was good, and my daughter did enjoy it but it just didnt feel like value for money. We met some mice things (sorry I dont know what they were, I think out of cinderella) We met snow white and a prince who were lovely. We met Cinderella, and I dont mean to be rude, I mean this from my kids point of view if that makes sense, but she was so unattractive that it just sort of killed the magic. The lady playing the role was French and lovely but you could just tell the kids wernt feeling it. We finished dinner and we were waiting for repunsal for an hour. The staff were politely trying to kick us out but we said we were waiting for her and not moving until she came. There was plenty of free tabels, and we saw repunsal visiting other tables. So for   170 we were waiting! She eventually came and she was lovely, very kind and really really looked the part. The food in there wasnt upto much. Very little choice and very posh. Almost too posh but I get the scene their trying to create. Id possibly avoid this if I was you. Just because of the price.   100 for cafe mickey was much much more fun.Thursday was the best day by far. It had been freezing all week. But Thursday it warmed up slightly. It was much quieter and we got so much done in both parks. Loved it. Friday, the day we were driving home. We had to leave about 6pm to make the eurotunnel so plenty of time to get stuff done. Unfortunatly it was like wednesday and was very very busy. Not sure why. But a great day all the same.To summerise there were times in this week I almost wanted to cry. There were times I laughed, looked on in wonder, felt real magic, loved rides and felt like a kid. Its a real up and down experience.The French staff at the park are lovely. So helpful. Im of the opinion disney wouldnt work if it were in England as the staff wouldnt be as helpful. Ive no idea what people have on the French?! Their great at Disney. The only problems we had were with horrible rude English holiday makers and students who were more like rodents! (im English too!)I could go on forever. If your thinking of going, go. I really didnt want to leave come Friday evening. Just expect some dissapointment along the way and make the most of it. The memories will last forever for you and your kids. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"

            "Translation error: Let   s just imagine for a minute the meeting with senior Disney executives and the agenda is to decide where to locate the European Disney Resort. Old Uncle Walt would have already chain smoked himself into Forest Lawn Memorial Park so it was left to some numbnut to suggest Paris as an appropriate location.Of course, as well all know there   s nothing whatsoever wrong with Paris, France with the exception of two key things: the traffic is the first and secondly, France is filled with French people. If you go to Disney Paris, be aware that you will very soon come into contact with both.Now, in 2015, you have driven several hours, the latter two covering around half a mile, to reach your Hotel destination to be assured by a fabulous French hurrah for all your efforts and the promise of the best time of your life.If you now drive up to the gate of the Newport Bay Club Hotel you will be confronted with another two things     scaffolding and a large security guard. You will have a conversation with the latter like this: NBCH Security (with French accent)         Open le boot   You (now tired and with overtired children screaming)    I   m sorry?   NBCH        Open le boot   You    I   m sure it opens if you would like to try?   NBCH        you need to get out and open eet   Then, your wife gets out to open the jam packed boot while the Security Personality of 2015 probes into a world of soiled nappies and empty crisp packets to be released beyond the barrier. As you breathe a sigh that he didn   t spot the three vertically challenged stowaways hidden between the pushchair and the cases (not really of course), you progress without any instruction or welcome to the scaffolded facade that is your hotel entrance. At this point, you have no idea if you are in the right place, you unload the car but again, it seems incomprehensible that after paying thousands of pounds to Mr Disney, you need to send a scout to find out if we are indeed where we should be.You unload without help or trolleys and form a line of delivery for bags to a busy reception. You find that all the staff are dressed like 19th C New Englanders and now you look forward to that    Disney welcome drink or at worst, a cheerful    old new England    Puritan non alcoholic beverage.Prepare to have your disappointment increased however in that your new host at Reception is fact now telling you that    your pre booked    Character Breakfast    is now not on Tuesday as you had booked it, rather it   s on the Wednesday (no reason) ; dinner needs to be booked right now if you want any hope in hell of getting something to eat tonight and if you need anything beyond my minute brain function you will have to discuss it with the Concierge.    You may even get a shoulder shrug, something you will experience again before the holiday is out.The Concierge is a skilled and accomplished shrugger. When asked if there was a spare luggage trolley or dare I say, someone who would be remunerated to push it? You will be shown an opened door with a room with luggage in it and another shoulder shrug. I hope you understand that this means    your request cannot be accomplished at this moment in time.    The rooms are fine, Disney themed with furniture with straps and buckles like steamer cases. They were unbearably hot so when we phoned reception to ask for the cots we had pre booked (I imagine that anything to do with    pre booking    will be a room with two grinning Donald Ducks who when they receive the booking , they chuckle as they rip them up into little pieces and throw them in a large bin) they were delivered by another Puritan who when asked how the air conditioning worked he replied    it   s off because it   s not    ot   . You may then detect another shrug? You wouldn   t be wrong.Look, you may think this was all going fairly badly, and to be honest it was, but we are British after all and we are going to make the best of it aren   t we? The restaurant downstairs via the smallest lift in history was pleasant, if not quite Cape Cod, but the food was terrific, as you would expect.If you felt that this would be delivered with a chirpy Disneylike cheer, then I   m afraid I   d remind you that in France, you your waiter is only a few evolutionary steps away from the Stasi and it pays to remember this when expecting one to cheerfully pat your small child on the head like a friend while pouring your 35 Euro bottle of wine saying    have this on us for making your life a miniature version of hell since you arrived.    After a steamy    ot night, we regrouped for breakfast and enjoyed the usual continental fare. It   s also pretty good and enjoyable if you can actually sit down but if you are unlucky enough to be shown one of the tables at the back of the room, near the wall, you will of course regret the extra saut  ed potatoes you had the night before as you will not be able to get to your chair, such is the space allowed.To resort to telling the staff again is beyond your will to live and it was easier to split up and sit strangely in a row of four facing the wall and then others to alternative tables. This is what we did now.The Parks are fantastic, as you would imagine. The service is terrible, as you would imagine.The staff are a pretty tetchy bunch and if you wanted help of any sort, I   d try the internet rather than a face to face collision. The food is good although who would in their right mind spend over 38 Euros for    Surf n Turf    in the Blue Lagoon restaurant I   m not sure. I reckon I   d want to have some part in catching it and having a new breed of fish named after me for that price?The Character Breakfast is an interesting experience in that we were told by another Puritan that this was to be held in the aforementioned Cape Cod Restaurant in the Hotel. Of course this proved to be a total fabrication of the truth and you should go to Caf   Mickey, in The Village. When you protest at this confusion, after an appropriate pause for a shrug, you hot foot over to the last sitting and find yourself again, sat in the corner away from the throng of queuing people waiting for Saucisse (sausages to you & me) , that never seem to arrive, and the various people standing next to Mickey, Minnie or a Chipmunk. The Sausages seemed to sum up the whole Paris experience. A person two or three in front of myself took the last sausage in the large terrine like container     fair enough I hear you say. Then you stand with two or three others in a small disconsolate but hopeful group, and wait in the belief that another batch will arrive by a happy staff member dressed as a sausage chef. You even witness other staff looking at the empty container and then see them drift off to another place with an emotional shrug as they glide away to wipe a surface or stack glasses. You then take the disillusioned view that your sausages will not arrive and retire, bacon in hand to try to grab Pluto   s attention (or their bodyguard who travels with them around the room). Oh, by the way, why don   t you have any tea spoons for stirring your coffee? Is this too much to ask?After a while, you are aware you have now become a shrugger yourself at the recurrent indifferent view your service providers will offer you; The coffee vendor in the Studios Park who sighed when presented with a twenty euro note and then asked to see the change in your pocket in disbelief that you couldn   t work out what the small coins were; The Crepe vendor in the Disneyland Park who took great pleasure in handing over a cup of coffee with the outside cup temperature of a blast furnace. You see, this will become normal so when you receive really nice service from the guy in the Rainforest Caf  , it comes as a complete surprise and you find yourself tipping him as if he was in need of third world aid.I   ve been to Disney World Resort three times now and the main difference between Paris and Florida is it takes less time to get to Florida and the staff have a disposition resembling a personality.There   s some really nice things about EuroDisney I   m sure. Its just I didn   t get to see them. I   m afraid that the investment in a customer service experience befitting the brand in Paris will be substantial and I for one, wouldn   t be waiting for the change the mind set of the people we met and who work for the operation. I   m sure they are the minority but when you pay your money, you surely deserve to make your choice. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"

            "Translation error: My husband and I travelled to Euro Disney (as they called it then back in 2006'.Compared to back in 2006 it seems to have gone a little downhill sadly ... Or maybe we were spoilt with a trip to Florida in 2007 who knows.We decided to travel to Disneyland Paris as it was closest, easiest and cheapest for our two children (2 years and 6 years). We stayed at the Kyriad hotel which suited nicely as it wasn't too far away and offered free shuttles to and from Disney each day.Upon arriving at Disneyland (which was a complete surprise for our children) it was sadly pouring with rain. Being English we are used to the odd downpour but we did fancy a Poncho and so we queued for almost 30 minutes at a small booth for a poncho for us and the kids . We found the ques appalling! People were shoving and shouting and quite frankly my husband looked totally bewildered by the idea of having to push and shove for a bit of plastic and he is too polite to push and be rude, thus it took us a long time to buy said poncho and the staff seemed far from happy with the situation. Luckily the weather improved throughout the day and so we were able to get dry again later. My son was happy to be at Disney , he was surprised but I don't think it was what he thought it would be ...  Firstly , he couldn't understand why on earth a queue would be almost an hour long for a ride which only lasts up to two minutes. I agreed and we soon figured out the fast pass route followed by the baby switch facility which is simply fab ! We managed about four rides on our first day as it was so busy but we got into the swing of things further along in the week.By day two we were starting to beats he queues with fast pass and baby switch and we had figured out to shop at a local supermarket to beat the prices. Top tip for anyone, especially families with kids is to make picnics as the prices in Disney as extortionate !!! We ate each day at one of the picnic locations near to a park. The kids loved the park (pochahontas themed park). However, we continued to be bombarded by wasps and unfortunately on my second day I was stung twice by a wasp , this sent my son into a panic every time a wasp so much as flew by... And they are everywhere in Disney it's a serious problem which seriously needs addressing.Things have really changed in terms of money, you can see this as whilst we greatly enjoyed watching the late night fireworks and light show ,it wasn't what it was when we first saw it many years ago. The fireworks are only very few in comparison to what we have seen in the past and they now rely up water and lights to create a show which I suppose was better for my son as he hates loud bangs. Personally though , the more fireworks the better for me. Saying that ,my daughter hated being in the dark so sadly we spent our time trying to watch said show whilst consoling our two year old and holding out six year olds ears incase of a sudden bang (which there aren't any for any parents with children who suffer with noise issues). Another big difference is the parades, when we first went parades were twice a day followed by the huge parade at night time prior to the fireworks... Now there is one parade a day and in between this they do a mini parade which includes a horse and cart with the frozen princesses in which lasts about ten minutes.... My daughter loved this as she developed a deep love for Anna whilst there.Frozen was certainly the theme of Disney obviously as its a hit film and the kids all love it (including me and I'm 32!). We had the pleasure of watching the frozen singalong which is well worth queuing for, it is magical as I took the time to record it on my iPhone, my daughter now spends at least twenty minutes each day since watching it ... Over and over ... And over and over .... She still waves to Anna even now from our kitchen table whilst having her snack.The shops!!! I love shops but my god there are loads and they all sell pretty much the same, it never used to be like that. Once upon a time each shop seemed to sell different merchandise which meant that you were more inclined to go into each one ... Now it is literally the same in every shop apart from the Christmas shop which was divine. We ended up spending an absolute fortune on merchandise as we are huge Disney fans. Upon returning home I sadly found that much of it was available on the disneystore for less than the park price :( At least our stuff is labelled with  Disney parks   but still, it doesn't seem fair that it's more expensive there than online ... So my tip would be to purchase your Anna, Elsa, Olaf or whatever else and take them with you to save tears from either your child or your wallet.My favourite shop is still the main one (emporium) but try to go early in the afternoon to avoid the hustle and bustle. The rides were fab but we're disappointed to find its a small world was shut until December. The kids enjoyed the rides and those that they couldn't ride were still accessible to my husband and I thanks to the baby switch facility. My only issue with the rides involves Thunder Mountain which seemed to break down at least twice a day (this happened all week ). My son and I had the pleasure of being the first back onto the ride following a closure and whilst he enjoyed it , I was slightly worried we would be one of the poor people climbing off on the ramp if it got stuck again (luckily it didn't). This needs fixing Disney if you're reading !!!I love Disney and I love the whole experience of visiting their parks but something was missing this time ... The magic ? I'm not sure .... It was sooo overcrowded and busy, I found that every time I needed the loo I was faced with a ten  twenty minute queue in the ladies whereas my husband went straight in and out. Perhaps more toilets for women with kids are required ?? Queues for food and toilets were awkward as who wants to wait for essentials with young kids ?!I think all the advertising of  now you can say yes   is because it can be achieved for cheaper these days with deals I guess and so now the park is packed to the rafters... This takes the magic away as it becomes crowded and uncomfy.We visited for five days using a five for four ticket from attraction tix (great value for tickets if your interested). We did have fun and the kids have memories to last a life time as we made it magical in our own way. I just hope Disney reads this and realise they need to reinstall some of their magic into their park.  --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"

            "Translation error: It's going to be difficult to write this review without sounding obnoxious. Basically, if you've never been to Walt Disney World in Florida and you enjoy theme parks or are a Disney fan, then go ahead and don't read my observations below   jump in with both feet and you'll probably have a wonderful time. I would say 'try to avoid school holidays', but being a teacher myself and having school age children I get extremely irked when I read that advice in other reviews, so just grab the opportunity to go when you can. I'd recommend May half term rather than August, due to crowds and heat.If, however, you have been to Orlando and, like us, cannot afford to go again but are feeling the need for a hit of Disney, this review might be worth your while reading   especially if you had the time of your life in Florida, and more particularly if you are likely to end up spending a third of what the Florida fortnight cost you on a 4 day break at Disneyland Paris. In short, and in the opinion of my family, it is not worth it. Keep saving, leave it another few years and go back to Orlando would be my advice.Maybe we're just grumps, but my husband and I found ourselves making unfavourable comparisons with WDW at every turn. Below I've summed up our niggles in 9 points.1. Queuing. We had to be on our guard in every queue because several times people tried to push past us (it was the same being increasingly squished while waiting for the parade). Americans tend to share our disapproval of queue jumping (or cutting in line, as they call it), which makes it all seem more civilised and relaxed. Of course, not everyone at WDW is American or British (though very many are), and of course there are Americans and Brits who also queue jump, and I am sure the majority of visitors from other countries don't, but we noticed a particular cultural difference. (See? I told you it was going to be difficult to write this without sounding obnoxious!) I'm only commenting honestly on our experience.2. Queues and Fastpasses. The updated system at WDW means you can now book three fastpasses in advance, per group, per day. If, like us, you are limited to school holidays I cannot overemphasise what a difference this makes when it comes to actually getting on the rides you've paid the earth for, without waiting for inordinate amounts of time.3. Rider switch. My children are aged 13, 11 and 2, so there were a couple of rides the older two wanted to do which weren't suitable for Little Daughter. Rider switch allows one parent to look after the smaller child while the first parent rides with the other two, and then the first parent can ride without queueing, taking one of the older children on with them. Hmm. At WDW BOTH the older children were allowed back on. Another small point, but it saved arguments.4. Smoking. It really isn't pleasant to join a queue, especially if it's a hot day, and have someone behind you decide that there and then is the perfect time to light a cigarette and smoke all over their children and yours. Once again, Americans tend to share our (or my!) dislike of smoking, and smoking is banned everywhere in the parks except for designated smoking zones. So civilised, to my way of thinking, and hopefully even if you're a smoker you'll agree.5. Scope and choice. We didn't moan about this, because that would have been particularly obnoxious, but the fact remains that there is SO much more to do at WDW. We found ourselves missing Soarin' at Epcot, and Dinosaur at Animal Kingdom, as well as the amazing water parks (we had a heat wave in Paris this week, which was really uncomfortable because they just don't do air con like the Americans do   not that I blame them, because that kind of heat is not an everyday occurrence ... but it did make for a sweaty old time).6. The WDW app. Just a little thing, but it's awesome: you can check wait times and book fastpasses on your phone there and then, without having to trek over to boards or queue at machines.7. Princesses. A big one, this, if you have your own little princess(es). My husband had to queue for 40 minutes, despite arriving early, to get a reservation to meet a princess. It was just one princess, and you're not told which. We then had to queue for a further 45 minutes at the reservation time for Little Daughter to meet her. It was Rapunzel, whom she likes, but as she came out she saw the photos of Ariel (her favourite) who'd met the family in front of us, and was fairly distraught that she couldn't meet her. At WDW you can get a fastpass to meet the princesses, there are two or three of them, there's barely any wait and it's magical.8. Birthdays. My son, who is lucky enough to have his birthday during the summer holidays, got to wear a birthday badge last time we visited WDW and we lost track of the number of cheerful cast members (staff) who greeted him and wished him a happy day. It really was lovely. This time, it was his birthday again, so my husband got him a badge from City Hall ... and one person wished him a happy birthday. I know that whole upbeat American stereotype can irritate some people, but in a theme park   in a DISNEY theme park   I think it's the way to go. Same with being greeted with a huge smile and wished a magical day when you arrive: it makes a difference.9. Organisation. To give just one example   we joined a queue to board the train that circles the park. No wait time was posted, no train arrived (in the time we waited, at least), no announcements were made and no staff member was on hand to ask. We later discovered the other stations around the park were closed and only one train was in operation. At WDW this would have been made clear.Of course, there were some good bits. We loved Davy Crockett's Ranch where we stayed, enjoyed the new Ratatouille ride and fell quite in love with Cinemagique (these two attractions are both at the Studios park). The Pirates ride at Paris is better than at WDW, with two decent drops instead of one. You can also get real coffee and real beer, if you so desire. Best of all, we didn't have to get on a plane (I have a real phobia of flying, but such is my love of WDW that I will do it again if we can ever afford to revisit!).If you want great cuisine and culture, visit la belle France. If it's the best theme parks in the world you're after, save and save the pennies and visit WDW. You won't be disappointed. Check out airlines such as Norwegian Air for genuinely cheap(er) flights and stay off the resort to dramatically cut the cost. Hiring a private villa with a large group is a thrifty way to go. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"

            "Translation error: Just back from a family trip to EuroDisney Paris. It was everything I feared it would be ... but far worse! To sum up my experience in three words: Queues, queues, queues.The bad. The weather was unbearably hot, 100F, not Disney's fault I know this would not have been nearly as bad if it wasn't for all the time required to be outdoors queuing. I would never go again in summer. Food overpriced. Merchandise overpriced. Not enough picnic and play areas. Kids got bored and tetchy with queues. The good   the staff were all very friendly and well trained whilst doing a very stressful job with stressed customers. Felt safe on rides. The other guests were also very polite despite the sufferance. Shame that smoking was allowed in the park. I know outdoors but why should I have to breath in other peoples filth whilst standing in queues and watching parades? Parade good. Park buildings and landscaping lovely.Monday. I arrived by packed shuttle bus which was full to bursting and crawled through rush hour traffic. I waited 15 minutes to get my bag xrayed at security. I then waited thirty minutes to get my pre paid ticket even though the queue was short and the counters fully manned. Why is this process so slow when the kids are desperate to get into the park. I then waited ten more minutes at park entry. I then set off to 'Adventureland' and walked to the Pirates ride and waited forty minutes   which then promptly shut down due to a technical fault just as I was about to board. So we went instead to the haunted house which said 15 minutes queuing time but which was 45 minutes in extreme heat. Haunted house story was all in French and therefore meaningless. And that was my morning. In the afternoon thought about the Frozen sing a long but queues were prohibitive. Went on Thundermountain in afternoon with a fastpass ticket   it was good but still had to wait twenty minutes. Gave up with other rides due to queues and went to some of the lesser attractions instead. Tuesday: Walked thirty minutes to park to avoid bus overcrowding. Found secondary entrance with no queues. Went to 'Fantasyland' but Peterpan ride shut due to technical fault. Did a few rides but generally disappointed with the quality and length of rides. Not nearly as good as I'd expected. Waited an hour for the star wars simulator which was good but not worth the tortuous queue. Queues for toilet, queues for water fountain. Gave up and retreated to hotel at this point and returned in the evening. Evening parade good. Jaques Cousteaux future ride closed. Gave up queuing for Automania. Went to rockets instead   said 15 minute queue but was twice that for 1 minute ride. Laser firework show at castle excellent and highlight of show..Wednesday: went to Disney studios park. Rushed to Crush ride early to avoid queues only to wait 70 minutes for a 60 second rollarcoaster in the dark. Massively disappointed. Meanwhile, another family member had to wait 20minutes just to get a fastpass ticket for Ratatouie. Went to a animalmajique show which was pants. Went to Ratatouie which had just broken down. So gave up and went back to the hotel for a swim instead. Thursday. Had a morning before flying home. Tried to go on rides that had been unable to get on previously. But pirates shut again. When did return, queues forty minutes long and, unlike my companions, I was not prepared to endure. Went on 'behind the scenes' tram   which was just garbage. Peter Pan ride was closed again but then reopened. It was so dark I couldn't see anything! I'm told this is a problem in the summer because there is not time to allow your eyes to adjust! Summary. Any other company expecting families with young children to queue for hours in the baking sun would be prosecuted for child abuse! I don't understand why people tolerate the queues ... the park clearly is all about the rides and yet can't accommodate so many people. The same people that would blow a fuse if they had to wait for half an hour in an airport security line for a two hour,   60 plane trip seem to be remarkably tollerant when waiting an hour and more for a sixty second mickey mouse ride with their family   when they have paid thousands of pounds for the privilege. Everywhere I looked I saw strained parents and frustrated kids all frazzling in the heat. Disney are so sneaky about the queues. First you stand for twenty minutes in the sun to get to the entrance of the attraction, and the queue doesn't look so bad; then you turn a corner to be confronted with a cattle shed of people twisting back and forth hidden round the side of the attraction  thirty more minutes; then you enter the building where you spend another twenty minutes in corridors constantly going round bends but not knowing how much longer you have to endure. If anyone could see the length of the queue from the onset they would never join in the first place. I do not know how this place averages a rating of four stars; it's just not worth the pain and misery and the money! --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"

            "Translation error: So if you've done the USA Disney thing then you'll find this Park smaller and similar. If you have not then you'll find it large and amazing.The Park itself has all the usual Disney magic you'd expect (unlike the Disney Studios Park). However its not operating the Fastpass  system so still stuck with the ticket booth system for fast passes and many of these didn't work or were closed. The park had a strange lack of Characters and zero photo spot photographers so don't waste your money on a memory maker or photopass card as there's nobody to get your photo with and nowhere to have one taken by a cast member like in the USA despite these being sold! Also the ride photos don't all work. The flora and fauna is decent but not a patch on the USA version. The food is the same format but with a French take on USA cooking. This is a bit hit and miss. Amazingly the French couldn't cook a steak to save their life here and the size of the steaks was anything but in line with the massively expensive prices! Price wise the park is the same as all Disney attractions, expensive, how much? and extortionate being the three prices to be found. But you can save your money by drinking water from the fountains and eating your own lunch made before and this is what most people were doing in the parks until Dinner time when food spots were very busy.The rides themselves were (if you've done USA) an acceptable replica, a pleasant surprise and a few of them were a little old fashioned compared to the US. Dissapointingly, almost the entire of the Tomrrorwland secotr was shut including Space mountain, Nautilus and Orbitron. This made crowds surge for the other rides and meant massive lines as it was the kids holiday. There were plenty of break downs too and the worst was a 2 day brake down of the Thunder Railroad which left the park without all it's major attractions outside of the Indian Jones coaster which ensded up with 2 hour lines.If you have never done the Disney thing then you'll love this place no matter what but if you are a regular to USA then you'll be kinda of like  Good but no cigar! . The parades were okay but not as frequent or as extravagant as USA. The night Time Main Event was a combination of the USA's hollywood studios Fantasmagorical, EPCOT's Closing Fireworks and the Magic Kingdim Castle closing show. It was in my opinion far better than the USA variant for Magic Kingdom but with few vantage points and no fastpass  it was one of those shows you have to get to early and stand your ground with the arrogant and rude French who push, shove, and generally invade your space like you are not there! After a ling day, this way annoy those of you who are not fans of their charming gaulish ways!The Lines were mostly longer than the USA but nowhere near as bad as the Disney Studios park which were just unbearable. Some of the rides just were not worth the wait. Specifically Indiana Jones Coaster (think old school cat and mouse ride from the 60s with a loop   very unDisney like on scenery, special effects and ride length being way way way too short, under 40 seconds). But on the plus side most of the favorite rides were there with Haunted Mansion, Pirates of the Caribbean and Thunder Railroad all potentially better than the USA variants. The park was easy to navigate and laid out in the traditional USA Disney Magic Kingdom hub spoke design with plenty of cut through pathways to make it fast to get around. Still felt big but was not as hard on the legs as the US versions. Don't get me wrong though...if you've never done these parks before anywhere then you can forget anything you know about funfairs and theme parks as Disney do stuff in a way you can't describe easily. The need and desire to want to keep going back was there, just like in the USA, so this park gets a thumbs up but it's standing alone in my opinion and let down by the other park, the crowds, the local culture and the lack of internationalism that is very abundant in the USA. Most rides here are in French which is I think acceptable as it is in France but there is a feeling somehow that they've almost purposefully avoided using any other language. Some of the rides rely heavily on the naration, pre ride scene setting or cast member interaction and so this became a bit meaningless even if you do speak a bit of French. As we are seasoned Disney USA visitors, the blanks were filled from memory but if you are new to this then you'll be missing out on some key atmospherics because they don't have much in English. Not even subtitles in most places. This aside, the rides still speak for themselves and the international language of laughter and fun is still predominate in this park. It's location to London is awsome and its amazing to step off a train and almost right into the park itself. Personally I think the park is overdue an upgrade like the one Florida has had with fast pass plus, the addition of the interactive games and the extra zealous cast members that don't exist in the French example. It's also at risk of being over crowded when major rides need repair overhaul and especailly when the only adjacent park shuts so early at 6pm.It's still Magical enough and is ultimately the mini me Magic Kingdom. First timers will be blown away but seasoned Disney fans won't be.  --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"

            "Translation error: I have been to Disneyland Paris quite a few times. The first time was in 1992 when it first opened.Back in '92 It was expensive but well organised and the staff in general were polite and helpful. They had a happy and friendly disposition which you would expect from a theme park.I am sad to say that the original park has deteriorated and in need of a make over. The restaurants and rides are generally unresourced which makes the whole experience painful.You would for example not expect there to be long queues just to get into a restaurant. We pre booked all of our restaurants but still had to queue to get in. A 1:00 pm reservation turned out to be an actual 1:35 get into the restaurant followed by slow service. This was more a staffing issue (presumably to save money)I was also disappointed by the number of rides being refurbished. When you pay   50 00 to get in to a park, you expect to see all of it, not 85%. but at least they are refurbishing the place as it does look tired. Closed rides included space mountain, the Jules Vernes experience, etc. Some rides were closed due to technical reasons including the Aerosmith ride and thunder mountain. (I thnk some serious maintenance is required)So what else can be done to improve the experience?Add a few benches for people to sit on. There are very few places to sit, especially if you are wobbly on your legs.Fit better signage. You can spend quite a while finding things. A few extra well placed signs would go a long way.(signs in English, German, Italian, Spanish etc would not go amiss)Transport.Getting from the 'charles de gaulle' airport was a nightmare. The airport is very large and poorly signed. We laned at terminal 2 and had a train journey from the terminal to our baggage carousel. A journey of 20 30 mins. None of this was explained and we found the staff ignorant and rude.The actual bus transfer from the airport to the resort was also an experience. The driver spoke no english despte the fact that all passengers were from england. I can spek some French so I could understand the instructions (to an extent). The bus assistnat made NO ATTEMPT to help passengers with there luggage. He merely watched passengers of all ages putting there own luggage on the bus. (lazy and rude)The driver yelled 'Quelle Hotel' which i could understand but many travellers could not understand his ruse questioning.The hotel staff at the Sequoia were excellent. Friendly, well spoken and very helpful.The hotel was clean and quiet.You could walk from the hotel into Disneyland (10 15 mins) or catch a shuttle bus. Again no explanation by the driver that you needed to get off at the train station and walk 500 metres into the park.FoodAs was previously, the cost of food in the park is very expensive. I would recommend buying the food vouchers before you go, but dont buy a full board option, opt for the half board. You will get too tied down watching the clock for your next meal time.A half board option lets you choose a lunch time treat (tere are lots of places to get sandwiches, burgers etc...i.e. Earl of Sandwich, McDonalds etc)The meal vouchers are poorly explained but please note that you should book your restaurants early as the restaurants get full and you may not be able to get in. Also, some restaurants are only open lunch time ot tea time (some both)Beer is not always available...we found beer available at tea time but not lunchtime in some restaurants.Restaurants were understaffed and the service slow. The odd restaurants were however excellent i.e. Walts restaurant on Main street.We booked our restaurants on the first day (of a 5 day holiday) and the best time we could get into Cafe Disney (for a character dinner) was at 10:00pm. Not good enough when you have a 1 year old and a 5 year old.Menus also need a clarification which states which level of meal voucher you are using. We had a 'plus' meal voucher which allows you to use a certain number of selected restaurants and a particular set of meals.... this is unclear and it is easy to order food that is not on your meal plan.Snack Vouchersyou also get a set of snack vouchers which we found wee useless. You can only redeem these at certain times in certain venues. WE ended up throwing ours away. They need to be available for use all day and in all venues to be of any use.SmokingSmoking is allowed in the park...Entry TimeIf you visit by car and for the day, you will only be able to get in after 10:00am. Be prepared to queue for 30mins or more to get in.For people stopping in the complex, i.e. any hotel or the camp davey crocket, then you can get in at 8:00 but note that not all rides are open at 8:00 so it is a little bit misleading.Also, you need to access the park by the right hand queue (poorly signed) and show your disney hotel pass ID card. This gets you past the longer queues (day tripper queues)Ride Waiting TimesTimes displayed on the waiting time boards ere not particularly accurate. 10 mins could mean 20mins etc.Overall scoreI will go to Florida next time as the french resort is dated and in much need of a make over. The site is understaffed and the staff morale is generaly low. (not enough smiley faces)5 10 --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"

            "Translation error: Moi-même et ma femme avons visité Euro Disney pour ses célébrations tardives du 50e anniversaire. Nous avons séjourné à l'hôtel Magic Circus Off Site de 23 5 à 26 5. Nous avons eu un laissez-passer de 2 jours pour les parcs pour 24 5 et 25 5. Saturday 24 5 transformé en probablement le pire jour de notre vie. Nous sommes arrivés au parc à 10h45 et avons été accueillis à une mêlée de 15 minutes et 1000 personnes pour obtenir la sécurité dans le site. Une fois que nous l'avons atteint, nous avons obtenu nos billets. Comme j'avais la prévoyance de préserver cela, nous avons réussi ce peu rapidement et sans tracas. Une fois dans le parc, nous nous sommes dirigés vers l'arrière car c'était le quartier le plus calme. Après une file d'attente de 15 minutes pour monter sur le petit tour du monde, nous avons ensuite réussi à monter sur Casey Junior et un voyage de conte de fées. Il était maintenant à midi et le parc se soulevait avec des gens. Nous avons décidé d'aller sur le chemin de fer qui a encerclé le parc. Après une attente de 40 minutes, nous avons réussi à faire le tour, ce qui a duré environ 20 minutes. Nous avons commencé à faire la queue pour le déjeuner vers 1 h 15 et après 20 25 minutes à ce qui était la file d'attente de restauration rapide la plus lente que j'avais jamais vue, nous avons réussi à manger. Il était maintenant près de 14 heures, nous nous sommes donc dirigés vers Phantom Manor. Après une file d'attente de 45 minutes, nous sommes entrés dans la porte principale. Après une attente de 15 minutes, on nous a alors dit qu'il était tombé en panne et avait été utilisé une porte de sortie, donc une heure entière gaspillée. Nous nous sommes tournés vers Big Thunder Mountain, attendons 100 minutes pour une balade de 90 secondes et le chemin rapide ne fonctionnant pas, nous avons décidé de ne pas le faire aux pirates des Caraïbes et une autre heure d'attente. Il était maintenant vers 16 heures, nous avons donc décidé d'obtenir une glace et d'attendre le défilé. Après une autre file d'attente de 20 minutes pour la crème glacée, nous avons essayé d'obtenir une place pour le défilé. Quelle blague, les gens se tenant à 5 profonds avec des enfants sur leurs épaules afin que nous puissions voir tout le gazon. En désespoir de cause, même en train de monter un autre trajet, nous sommes retournés aux Pirates des Caraïbes. Nous avons fait la queue pendant une heure et sommes montés en balade, à mi-chemin de cela s'est arrêté. Après s'être assis dans le bateau pendant 15 minutes, le personnel dans les cuissardes a semblé nous tirer sur le côté et nous avons grimpé une sortie d'urgence. Pour être juste, ils nous ont donné un billet prioritaire pour une autre balade en compensation, mais nous avons dû nous tenir dans une autre file d'attente pendant 15 minutes avec des gens qui poussent et la file d'attente sautant pour obtenir les billets! Il était maintenant 6h45 et épuisé, nous sommes retournés à l'hôtel pour nous rafraîchir afin de revenir dîner et de voir les feux d'artifice à 23h. Nous sommes revenus au parc à 8h45. En pensant que nous pouvions avoir quelque chose de décent à manger, nous nous sommes dirigés vers le restaurant Blue Lagoon, mais on nous a dit que nous n'avions pas réservé qu'ils ne pouvaient pas nous faire entrer. Nous sommes retournés dans un restaurant Burger, il a fermé 5 minutes plus tôt comme le restaurant Pizza. Donc, le dîner était un Croque Monsieur à Main Street, il n'y avait aucun moyen que nous puissions obtenir une table pour nous asseoir, nous avons donc dû manger cette assise sur le trottoir en esquivant les pieds du piétinement! Maintenant aux feux d'artifice (littéralement). Se tenait sur le trottoir pendant une heure en essayant de rester à l'endroit où nous pouvions voir. Écarré par des gens sans pensée pour personne sauf eux-mêmes et battu par des poussettes. 5 minutes avant, cela devait démarrer un idiot se tenir juste devant nous et mettre son enfant sur ses épaules pour que ni nous ni les gens derrière nous ne puissent voir une chose. Avant de pouvoir dire quoi que ce soit, le Britannique derrière moi attrape le mec et les cris Cheers mec, nous sommes restés ici pendant une heure et maintenant aucun de nous ne peut vous voir égoïste * !! * Les gens ont ensuite commencé à pousser et à se bousculer avant de finalement déménager. Nous avons regardé les feux d'artifice et sommes retournés à la file d'attente de bus pour essayer de ramener la navette à l'hôtel à 11h30. Il y avait 2 bus pour environ 500 personnes. Chaque fois que l'on venait dans un béguin pour essayer de monter dans le bus, les adultes adultes se comportant comme des animaux poussant et poussant les petits enfants du chemin pour monter dans le bus, c'était dégoûtant. Un gars a même lancé physiquement un autre homme du bus dans la foule en attente car le conducteur ne pouvait pas fermer la porte et il ne descendait pas. Après une autre attente de 40 minutes, nous sommes finalement revenus à l'hôtel à 00:45 et sommes tombés au lit et le cauchemar s'est terminé.   100 et 14 heures plus tard, nous avions fait 6 manèges, dont 2 sont tombés en panne, pour se tenir dans les files d'attente pendant des heures et être poussés, bousculés et traités comme des animaux. Toute cette journée a certainement changé mon point de vue sur le comportement humain dont certains séparent à peine des hums des singes. Lundi dans le studio était meilleur, mais il y avait encore 2 heures (pas de je ne plaisante pas) à attendre Ratatouille et 40 à 50 minutes pour la plupart des autres manèges. Les files d'attente alimentaires étaient plus petites mais l'endroit était toujours soulevé. À la hausse, nous avons contourné la file d'attente d'une heure pour Big Thunder Mountain et avons marché directement grâce à notre billet de rémunération de la veille. Si vous souhaitez soumettre vos enfants à cela, je pense que vous devriez réfléchir à nouveau. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"

            "Translation error: Ayant été à Disneyworld Orlando quatre fois avec mes enfants il y a de nombreuses années, cette expérience m'a donné une vie de souvenirs. Cette année, en mai 2015, j'ai décidé avec ma femme d'emmener ma petite-fille à Disneyland Paris. Je suis allé pendant six jours, cinq nuits et j'ai payé le forfait alimentaire Premium en plein conseil. J'ai séjourné à l'hôtel New York dans la station. L'hôtel était OK mais attendait plus pour un hôtel quatre étoiles. J'ai malheureusement eu un vol précoce et je suis arrivé à la station à 1020 heures du matin. On m'a dit sur l'enregistrement que la pièce n'était pas prête avant 15 heures. Pas bon quand vous avez un enfant de quatre ans qui se lève et voyage depuis 4 heures du matin. Dans la plupart des hôtels d'Europe, les chambres sont généralement disponibles au milieu de la journée. J'ai remarqué que les carreaux dans la salle de bain étaient fissurés le long du fond par le sol et que les lits étaient comme dormir sur des palettes en bois. Les parcs Disney étaient un déception, sept des manèges dans les deux parcs ont été brisés (ce qu'on ne vous dit pas avant de réserver ou d'arriver à la place), le parc était quelque peu sale et même si vous avez vu le personnel de nettoyage autour, ils étaient plus intéressés à marcher en trois et quatre, en parlant, en fumant et en ne faisant pas ce qu'ils ont été payés pour faire. Les plantes et les arbustes et les zones soi-disant entretenus étaient conservés. Les bâtiments des manèges semblaient fatigués de peinture usée. La majorité du personnel était poli, mais j'ai constaté que sur certains des manèges pour des enfants comme la fusée, Dumbo, Mad Hatters Rides, plus vous avez dû rouler dans la file d'attente. Il est apparu qu'en raison des files d'attente, un ou deux des manèges n'ont duré que 1 min 10 secondes. Ce parc est très différent des parcs américains, ce parc est très petit et vous pouvez vous rendre confortablement dans environ 2 jours et demi. Nous avons fait la queue pendant environ 2 heures quarante minutes pour obtenir une image et une signature de l'une des princesses. C'était presque que pour les autres personnages. Vous avez dû faire la queue à 1030 le matin pour obtenir un billet pour le pavillon de la princesse, mais on lui a alors dit que votre enfant ne pouvait en voir que l'un et pas les autres. Les files d'attente pour les autres manèges étaient trompeuses, il dirait 5 minutes quand ce fut 40 minutes lorsque vous avez passé la porte. Comment dire à un enfant qu'il ne peut pas y aller. Dieu merci, elle était un ange tout au long du voyage et nous avons fait la queue si nécessaire. Les gens peuvent dire que je me plains, mais quand vous allez aux parcs américains, vous vous attendez à ce que Disney fournisse au moins le même ou similaire, n'est-ce pas ?. Je dois mentionner les plans de repas. Ce sont cruellement trompeurs. Je suis allé pour un plan de premier plan complet et on m'a dit que je pouvais manger ce que je voulais du menu et dans n'importe quel restaurant du Disney Resort que je voulais. Pas si vous n'avez pas de réservation !!!!!!! Comment pouvez-vous réserver pour un enfant de quatre ans. Le plan premium vous permet de choisir parmi le menu Al Acarte, mais dans certains restaurants, ils ont le menu Plan premium, deux démarreurs, trois principaux et trois déserts à choisir parmi Wow !! Tout cela pour 125 euros (160 $) par repas pour trois. Un repas pour trois pourrait vous coûter jusqu'à 200 $ plus si vous n'achetez pas les plans de repas. Il y a d'autres plans inférieurs mais la nourriture est tout aussi mauvaise. Je ne savais pas que mon enfant serait limité à Froi Gras ou au saumon fumé. Je m'attendais à beaucoup plus de choix pour ce que j'ai payé. Ils ne vous disent pas quand vous réservez vos vacances !!!! On m'a dit que les premiers restaurants étaient le California Grill à l'hôtel Disneyland. Deux choses à dire à ce sujet, une mauvaise nourriture froide, un très mauvais service. Les repas de personnage qu'ils vendent, vous vous attendez à voir beaucoup d'entre eux là-bas, nous avons vu quatre personnages à un repas et trois princesses à une autre et nous avons dû attendre plus d'une heure pour voir la première princesse et bu en eau en attendant les autres car nous avions déjà mangé notre repas. Quand j'en ai marre des déchets, je suis allé dans une charcuterie qui a déclaré qu'elle ne prendrait pas mon bon pour un sandwich au fromage et au jambon. Finalement, une gestion du restaurant Walts nous a gentiment aidés à un bon que le bon a été accepté. Nous avons mangé au Lucky Nugget, ils ont pris nos bons et ont expliqué que nous perdrions de l'argent en mangeant là-bas, nous avons compris mais que nous avions un grand hamburger. Je dirai aller le dîner de Buffalo Bill qui était le meilleur !!! Le voyage dans l'ensemble était décevant compte tenu du coût que nous avons payé. Avec le recul, je l'aurais emmenée aux États-Unis pour ce petit plus. N'obtenez pas les plans premium, cela n'en vaut pas la peine. !!!!! Dans l'ensemble, ma petite-fille a passé un bon moment et nous avons fait le mieux que nous pouvions, mais je n'y retournerai pas et je conseillerais aux autres d'y penser avant d'aller à Disneyland Paris. Je pense enfin que les PDG de Disney doivent sortir et trier cela. J'aurais limogé quelques-uns de ces boss maintenant !!! Se soulager --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"

            "Translation error: Tout d'abord, j'ai été déçu. J'adore les parcs Disney, ayant été à Disneyland en Californie à plusieurs reprises et WDW en FL, plusieurs fois, j'ai été surpris par mon propre niveau de déception. Je suis dans le service client de Disney, le thème, les attractions et la nourriture. Je suis fan! Cela dit, Disneyland Paris n'a pas répondu à mes attentes dans le service à la clientèle ou l'entretien. Il semblait délabré dans de nombreux domaines, il n'était pas organisé, en termes de manque de files d'attente pour les personnages, de timing pour les spectacles et les défilés (20 minutes en retard, deux fois). Les personnages avaient l'air un peu minables, comme s'ils mettront la main des costumes de personnages de WDW. Si vous n'êtes jamais allé à WDW, ce parc peut sembler acceptable pour un correctif Disney, mais si vous avez visité Disney Parks aux États-Unis, vous serez déçu. Alors que ma famille et moi nous sommes amusés dans ce parc, si nous devions, nous en ferions une excursion d'une journée de Paris. Les attractions étaient amusantes à vivre, nous avons apprécié les comparer à ceux que nous avons été dans d'autres parcs, la plupart des attractions étaient meilleures que celles de WDW, mais encore une fois, le mauvais entretien était distrait de la magie. Phantom Manor, Big Thunder Mountain, Pirates of the Caribbean, Space Mountain: Mission 2 étaient tous merveilleusement sur le thème et beaux, à l'exception du manque d'entretien. C'était amusant d'entendre des accents britanniques sur des princesses comme, Snow White, Anna, Elsa & Jasmine. Ma famille a adoré vivre des attractions en français, en fait, elle l'a préféré aux options d'anglais même si elles ne comprennent pas du tout le français.  En ce qui concerne les membres de la distribution, je ne dirais pas qu'ils étaient impolis, je dirais que la plupart semblaient indifférents à interagir avec les invités, pas du tout comme WDW. Encore une fois, si vous attendez un service Disney comme nous le sommes habitués aux États-Unis, oubliez-le! Leur attitude a peut-être eu quelque chose à voir avec la façon dont ils ont été traités, j'ai vu de nombreux invités être impolis envers les acteurs, agissant comme s'ils possédaient l'endroit, leur parler et ne pas essayer de parler français du tout. Une autre note sur les invités, ils fument, ils fument beaucoup, il y a des zones fumeurs mais personne ne semble les utiliser. Nous avons vu de nombreux Européens fumer autour des enfants sans souci et fumer sur les lignes en attendant les manèges. C'était difficile à s'y habituer, car notre famille essaie de vivre un mode de vie sain et de devoir respirer dans la fumée d'occasion n'était pas idéal. Il était décevant de Disney et de leurs acteurs de ne pas faire plus d'efforts pour déplacer les fumeurs dans leur zone de tabagisme désignée. La seule fois où j'ai entendu une tentative, c'était lors de la tour de terreur, lorsqu'un invité a décidé de s'allumer à l'entrée du hall du trajet, une annonce enregistrée a été faite sur le haut-parleur fort et il a éteint sa cigarette après une dernière bouffée. À notre grande surprise, nous avons apprécié la nourriture, nous ne savions pas à quoi nous attendre et nous étions heureux qu'ils soient très accommodants avec l'allergie au gluten de mes enfants. Nous pensions que la présentation alimentaire était artistique, la variété du menu suffisamment suffisamment pour faire appel à nous les 6, la qualité et le goût de la nourriture étaient tous supérieurs à WDW (désolé, gourmets WDW). Le transport a été assez facile, les bus fonctionnaient régulièrement et tout à distance de marche décente. Mon mari et mon fils ont souvent marché vers et depuis les parcs de notre hôtel, Newport Bay Resort. À plusieurs reprises, nous sommes allés à l'avant dans les deux parcs, nous l'avons comparé à la distance entre World Showcase et Future World à Epcot, sauf que vous deviez montrer votre billet pour l'entrée. Les deux dispositions de parc étaient suffisamment similaires à MK et HS en FL que nous étions à l'aise avec notre sort très bientôt dans notre séjour de 5 jours. Nous avons vraiment apprécié les voies de l'ancienne de Disneyland Paris. Ils n'utilisent pas de bandes magiques, ils ont toujours des passes rapides, il n'y a même pas la technologie des billets d'index. C'était juste une analyse de votre billet et vous êtes dedans, c'était rafraîchissant.  Dans l'ensemble, nous avons passé un moment agréable car nous avons pu découvrir quelque chose de nouveau et d'intéressant, si nous n'avions pas déjà passé des vacances à Paris et a suivi un forfait très abordable (20% de réduction sur les billets Hotel & Park Half Board plus Plan de repas gratuits Hotel & Park Billets pour les enfants de moins de 7 50 bons) Nous aurions peut-être été plus déçus. Nous sommes heureux que nous ayons vécu Disneyland Paris, même avec tous les négatifs, je ne recommanderais tout simplement pas de venir des États-Unis uniquement pour un voyage à Disneyland Paris, visitez Paris, alors si vous avez le temps et l'argent, visitez DP pendant environ un jour. Même si nous n'avons pas vu ou fait tout ((normalement nous conquérions tous), nous avons raté Captaineo, Arcades, Riverboat, Keelboats, Legends of the Wild West)), nous avons senti que nous n'avions pas vraiment manqué quoi que ce soit et que nos 5 jours visitant les deux parcs étaient plus que suffisants pour visiter DP. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"

            "Translation error: We've stayed here a few years ago and had a much better experience then. I remember eurodisney being the hight of customer service, with everyone in staff adding to the  magical  experience, from the janitor to the reception and the characters.Now, staff looks tired and run down. Characters were nice to our daughter (4) when they were in their role, but ignored her when she spotted them walking to their destination. No explaining to a child why  King Louis  was obviously ignoring her (quiet area, she was yelling and pleading, he's her favorite Disney character). It was little things like this that just made the experience less  childhood dream  and more  mcDonalds . Housecleaning in the hotel threw her teddy bear onto our bed (he was face down with arms and legs mixed up). For a children's destination, I would expect them to tuck him in or at least put him nicely on her bed. It's a small amount of energy that makes all the difference. I know it sounds nit picky... I don't mean to be, but it was an accumulation of things like this that made it very noticeable that Disney was no longer  Disney . They didn't replenish the shower gel (we left the one tiny empty container out in plain sight, apparently they thought we should use only one between the three of us for three nights). They didn't say good morning or even acknowledge us when we met housecleaning in the hallway. Even when we said goodmorning to them. Our room was extremely cold, the windows were drafty, the heater wasn't working properly, the ventilation seemed bad. After a shower the room stayed wet with condensation for a long time. It smelled musty and was uncomfortable for sleeping. On our last night we discovered the bathroom was leaking quite badly and our daughters bed was on a large wet spot of carpet. When we mentioned it at our checkout the reaction wasn't very interested. I left wondering if they would even fix it. This being sequoia lodge, it was all the more surprising. We've had good experiences here in the past. To be fair, they tried to fix the heater on the first day, it just didn't seem to do much good.In the park, the rides were often stopped. One ride didn't work at all and we were told to get back in line, behind the queue that already formed to wait another 45 mins. The food was meh.... Especially for vegetarians there was little to get happy about. When my little one busted her lip playing with a fence, there was staff of a ride standing a meter away. They kept on talking to each other, barely acknowledging the screaming and panicking little girl with a bloody mouth next to them. They didn't offer a handkerchief or even a smile. I was let out of line with some unease and left to my own devices. I'll manage, but I had expected differently. On the positive, the Christmas activities are beautiful. The tree, the parade, the fireworks... Beautiful. Our concierge was really good, giving us blankets and new shower gel when we asked. We had a really nice dinner show at Buffalo Bill and a great experience at the restaurant of Ratatouille. But, what used to be  Disney  all round, is now something you occasionally find, making the experience decidedly less magical. It definitely felt like we were being herded around in mass entertainment (which obviously is true, but it was less noticable in previous experiences) and that no one could care less how our experience was.Being a Disney fan and very excited to see it at Christmas time and share it with my little girl... It was, to be honest, a little disappointing. The park and staff seem run down, the food a notch less good than before, the customer service quite a bit down from before, the rides breaking down a little too often, parts of the park (especially in Studios) looked neglected. I'm not sure when and if I ever want to go back. I sent them an email stating this (careful to let them know that I didn't want a refund or compensation) I got no reply yet. It just solidifies my idea that they could care less. So, if you are a Disney fan, you don't mind being herded around and are able to gloss over a myriad of little things... You'll be fine. The new rides are really nice, Ratatouille's ride is awesome, Crush's Coaster is really cool. But, if you go there to experience the  magic of Disney , you might be disappointed. Seems like new management has different views on what that magic entails.UPDATE: I got a package and letter from them this week stating they were taking my comments very seriously. They went above and beyond to make up for it, offering us compensation and a beautiful doll for my daughter. It really wasn't something I was aiming for, but it was really nice of them to do this. An email stating they would try to solve some of the issues would have been enough, so this is much more than expected. My idea that they could care less has certainly been disproven. I still stand behind my review, but am very glad they are trying to improve on these things, or that they are apparently just a case of bad luck on our part. Just wanted to let you know this. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"

            "Translation error: Cet endroit est horrible, aucun autre mot pour cela, des prix exorbitants, une valeur horrible, une terrible fourniture de nourriture, une organisation générale pauvre, oui, les enfants l'adorent, mais ils ne le voient pas pour les problèmes pratiques qu'il apporte. Notre visite avec le stationnement coûte 243 pour une journée dans deux parcs, plus de 12 heures dans les 2 parcs et 8 randonnées plus tard 30 par trajet, je ne me plaignerai jamais sur les funfairs britanniques. La file d'attente pendant 40 70 minutes pour la plupart des manèges, lorsque le travail ou entièrement opérationnel est inacceptable, nous avons attendu 30 minutes pour un trajet, il a ensuite brisé, nous avons persisté 15 minutes supplémentaires puis l'avons abandonnée. Chaque trajet sur lequel nous avons fait un wagon ou un obstacle similaire à être pleinement opérationnel. Le personnel, bien que généralement serviable et bilingue, n'a pas utilisé beaucoup de hâte pour maintenir les choses en mouvement. Un comportement fraudule ou des parents de la nation, qui était l'aspect le plus embarrassant de toute la visite, n'a pas aidé et que la file d'attente sautant se faufilant était un endroit commun, voir des adultes adultes courir à une balade pour battre 2 enfants vers un Dumbo volant était honteux. Fumer dans le parc devrait également être interdit car cela était assez problématique pour ma femme enceinte qui attend alors que nous avons fait la queue pour des manèges esquivant des troupeaux de fumeurs lourds qui se pressent autour de manèges, venez à Disney, obtenez avec le 21e siècle et considérez la santé des enfants, des parents fumeurs ... malchanceux. Même après les promenades qui se dirigent vers les sorties, j'ai dû esquiver les parents qui s'allument dès qu'ils sont partis. La fin de la journée a vu les détournements autour du château en raison des préparatifs d'affichage des feux d'artifice et de retrouver votre chemin dans l'obscurité espérait simplement suivre la foule et espérer qu'ils savaient la voie, la direction dans l'obscurité est presque impossible pour le nouveau visiteur. Nous sommes tombés sur deux employés indiquant avec des cyalumes au départ, alors plus d'aide. La provision alimentaire bien que répandue ne convenait généralement pas aux enfants et à nouveau les files d'attente étaient trop longues même en dehors des heures de pointe, nous nous sommes retrouvés à Plaza Gardens et je peux dire confortablement au cours de mes 46 années de voyage à travers le monde (dans la RAF), je peux honnêtement dire que c'était ma pire expérience culinaire. Le buffet international était loin de cela, c'était un mélange de nourriture qui ne pouvait pas être connu jusqu'à ce que vous entriez et payiez. Nous nous attendions à une expérience de type Jimmy Spices, à quel point nous étions faux, tout ce que vous pouvez manger et boire (boissons gazeuses) pour 75 pour deux adultes et un enfant était exorbitant, pas d'autre moyen de le dire. Pour la raison pour laquelle les réservations sont jamais faites à cet endroit, je ne comprendrai jamais, sans que nous ayons eu après 30 minutes et le menu du plateau buffet au-dessus du plateau fournissant une clé à la nourriture ne correspondait pas du tout. We were shown by a waiter to a table and he swept off crumbs with his hand as we approached, food choice was abysmal and two serveries quickly became one, a cheese board just disappeared and the same feral parents from the rides jumped queues to grab at the fresh serving of chips as others queued to get their measly choices of gristly lamb, over cooked pasta or burnt potato gratin and we like others padded our meals out with salad that was abondant et frais mais évité par la plupart. Il faut dire que la plupart des parents auraient été mieux invités à rentrer dans les salades au lieu des aliments gras tandis que l'option était juste devant eux. Un McDonald's a peut-être été meilleur, rapide et connu, des prix équitables et un meilleur service, même ils font également des salades. Les garnitures de boissons étaient difficiles à sécuriser et lorsque le personnel de Surly a pu le faire, cela semblait un inconvénient majeur. La fourniture des toilettes pour environ 400 sièges se trouvent; Pour les gents, un urinoir et une cabine et un homme italien serrant délicatement ses taches pendant un certain temps en retardant effrontément l'homme devant moi, les mains de ses enfants ont été lavées après les toilettes, les dames avaient deux cabines et puent fortement l'urine et les toilettes glissantes étaient faciles à détecter leur origine. Même les sols du restaurant étaient des débris de nourriture éparpillés au-delà de ce qui pourrait être raisonnablement attendu, heureusement pas avec de l'urine. Peut-être s'attendre à la nature de nombreux visiteurs. Une demande de cuillères de dessert ... pour le dessert a pris 10 minutes pour avoir effet. Je suis sûr que certains débouchés d'aliments d'Eurodisney fournissent un service équitable, mais mon expérience des jardins de Plaza était abyssale et ce n'est probablement pas un endroit sûr, et encore moins agréable à manger et toute autorité de licence examinant son aptitude doit l'évaluer, pour voir ce que nous avons vu. Mon conseil, évitez-le, prenez tous vos propres aliments, il peut y avoir peu d'autres choix. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"

            "Translation error: I don't really know where to start with my story of Disney land Paris. Their is the fairy tale view that you have the moment you walk in the park, the first thing you see is sleeping beauty's in front of you, your child face lights up, I am afraid it slowly goes down hill from their and you need to hide your, upset and stress from your innocent children. I was crying on the last day as the strain of what I had paid for and the reality finally hit me, it was the worst holiday I had ever had in my life and for   1500 to start with for 3 days 2 nights I am devastated.I will bullet for the problems as much as I can to inform people of the problems, not just my emotional response to the park as this would be my view and not everyone's. People all view things differently, what one finds except able the other may not, which is why I will list factual problems and some of the pros.PROSDisney express luggage is fantastic, you can not cope with out this. You take your luggage to Disney express at the station and its automatically taken to your hotel for you to pick up as late at 12am at night.Eating in the Plaza gardens restaurant is fantastic and they give you free refills with soft drinks, the only place in the entire park that does.If you reserve book a table at plaza gardens restaurant, you will have a wonderful meal.The rooms at the hotels are clean and spotless and all have a large tv in them (Chyanne has not got coffee or tea but a kettle!!!!! Tea lovers can obtain tea bags and sugar at breakfast but no milk) so if you wanted to stock up for your room, you could if you like it black.Go Full Board at the travel agent, don't buy food their, its 13 euros for a can of coke !!!!!!The Disney dreams show is fantasticThe parade is fantasticCONSThe park has no welcome pack for guests to explain the running of the park and how you must operate in order to have a happy stay.You can go to City Hall for help (Once you know) but its no more help than being given a map, program and being able to book restaurants. Don't even think of complaining or speaking to management, it simply won't work, you won't get past the front desk, they will stare and smile at you in a very patronising way to make you feel that all your complaining about is your fault and not theirs.You must, I REPEAT, you must reserve your lunch and dinner well in advance, so we are talking about on arrival on day one. You simply will not get a seat in the two good restaurants which are Plaza Gardens (Fantasy land) and Restaurant de Stars ( Disney Studios).I advise only ever eating in Plaza Gardens in main street, its the one everyone discovered and the best place to eat in the entire park with your HB and FB vouchers. If your paying for food then eat anywhere.It is a complete lie that the park rides are open 2 hours before for hotel guests and that the park is open till 11pm. This is for advertisement purposes only and to get people to Disney land Paris. The only rides open are 4 in Fantasy land and 3 in Discovery land, every single ride between 8am and 10am are closed, the Disney studios is closed till 10.For those of you who think that their will be Disney characters walking around, this is untrue, this does not happen at all. The little girls can have lunch with a princess for 80 euroes a ticket. The tickets at the princess pavilion for meeting a princess that supposedly you que up to get at 10.30am, are all gone by 12pm. If you want to do this, I would say, have a family member stand in the que at 8.30am, wait for 2 hours for the ticket and then get your appointment fast. Luckily I was told and was first in the que. but at 10.30am the que was 2 hours long. At the pavilion don't expect to meet all the princesses or to know who is going to be their, we had Belle, but Areil was their and we did not get to meet her. Its one or the other, its basically like Santas Groto at Christmas.Sometimes in the day they section a part off in the park and have characters their, so for instance at Alices maze, Alice was their, with a massive que to meet her, poo bear was somewhere else, then their was chip, dale and Eeyore, but its limited time, maybe 20 mins, their are Disney staff guarding them like its a prison and then they simply say, that it, with lots of children waiting with autograph books, then you have lots of sobbing children that are broken hearted. Don't spend out on a Disney autograph book at 12 Euros, you won't get it signed and Disney rake in the cash from all those empty books.One family complained, their daughter saw Rapunzel walking somewhere with the staff, the child ran over to get her autograph and the staff angrily said no. The child was left in tears.My daughter was left in tears waiting for a character to sign her book in the studios, they had roped off a section and they had lilo and stich, the Disney ducks, toys story and Cruella, 20 minutes it was roped off for all those people, the duck was next to my daughter and they refused to sign the book leaving her sobbing.They will close all the rides outside if their is even a slight suspicion of thunder, even though it never came close.The Crushes coaster is totally unsuitable for children under 7, may parents said their children were so traumatised coming off the ride. Most of the rides in the park are closed at 8pm, so even if the park is open the rides are not.Fantasy land is closed at 9pm, which means some rides being closed at 7.30pm due to the wait to close the ride at 8pm to get everyone out of fantasy land by 9pm. Its due to the Disney dreams light show that starts at 11pm, far to late for children.You need to be sat down early for parade. So if it starts at 4.30pm, you need to have a space at 3.40pm and camp out.Most of the staff that are in charge of the characters or the parade around the park, are rude and nasty and make life terrible. They act like prison guards when you can see that their is no issue at all to the safety of the characters as its for kids.No advise as to where maps or programmed are located.This last piece of advice, it sounds rather bizarre and as a childcare professional it went against my beliefs, its essential to get a Disney land 3 wheeled stroller for even 5 and 6 year olds. My daugher could actually not function, we were their 2 nights and 3 days, needed to get up at 6.30am every morning to have breakfast at 7am to get to park for 8am. Our daughter on arrival day was up at 5am, we got a train to Londen, tubes etc. We arrived at Disney at 1.15ish. by the 11pm light show she was asleep on the ground, in the morning we could not even wake her. I said to my husband that we will have to rent a stroller as she can't walk, we did and she spent the entire time in the stroller napping in between rides. We even bought a Disney blanket. It soon becomes apparent that this is a must, all the parents end up doing it, in fact I saw a 9 year old asleep in a stroller and well and truly out of it. The stollers are made of mettle, are basically a huge massive seat, they resemble disabled children's buggy's, but its a total need or your holiday will be ruined. One family did, 5 nights, but did, day one park, day 2 sleep till 12pm, day 2 park, day 3 sleep till 12pm and so on, but of you are their two night and 3 days your children will not even be able to walk after day 1 due to travel exhaustion.The ques are bad, up to 80 minutes for some and only I think 4 rides in the entire park are fast pass. In short, its not the dream as so many people think, the travel agents book is a con. We will never ever be going again. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"

            "Translation error: Just returned from my eleventh trip to DLP with hubby, son (8) and daughter (almost 5) and missing it already. There were a few negative points this time but overall we all loved it and had a fab time! We cannot recommend DLP more, especially to those who are Disney fans or have children who are. It is a truly magical experience for little ones.We had a 4 night stay in the Sequoia Lodge Hotel. We chose this hotel this time as stayed there previously and know it to be a 'cosy' and 'comfy' hotel, plus we knew it had been recently refurbished so wanted to check that out! Had a Montana Room, decor in Bambi style which was lovely...had that classic Disney touch. Rooms a little on the smallish side (we have stayed in the New York last couple of times and had forgot that rooms there are a little larger) but we were comfortable. As seasoned pro's we remembered our teabags, coffee, travel kettle etc. because there are NO TEA MAKING FACILITIES IN ROOM! If you, like us, like your little home comforts like that, you must remember to bring them with you. Very disapointed with lack of MILK   everywhere! Apart from milk at breakfast time, you can't get any in DLP anywhere!! (the nice stuff anyway). Did buy a couple of cartons from hotel shop but was gross, really creamy, like condensed..yuk. If anyone knows where you can buy 'proper' milk in DLP please let me know!!Also; swimming pool at Sequoia Lodge was freezing! Info at reception desk said water was 28 degrees   no way! Myself and my son could only manage to stay in for 5 minutes. Hubby and daughter managed a little longer, but way too cold to be enjoyable. I went and sat in Jacuzzi for a while and warmed up nicely but then the only way out to get back to the seating area and changing rooms is to go through the normal 'freezing' pool again. Awful!...took my breath away...what a ridiculous idea.Breakfast good, although missed the bacon and potato slices like on offer at the better hotels!Children enjoyed the ham and yoghurts.Disney characters appearing in the foyer   we had Donald and Goofy. No Mickey & Minnie, but again, that's when you remember this is only a three star hotel, and the more you pay hotel  wise, the better class of character you get...so to speak!It was a celebration of Spring in Disneyland Park so the Town Square, Main Street and the Castle stage were all decorated with brightly coloured flowers which looked really pretty and there were flower characters in the gardens in front of the castle which were lovely.Very satisfied with cleanliness etc of the grounds as usual. The first evening, my little girl insisted on walking around barefoot as she was dressed as Rapunzel and 'Rapunzel doesn't wear shoes!' There were not many people about and we were quite happy for her to do this as we knew the paths etc were so clean. However, after a while, one cast member did point out that my daughter was not wearing shoes...my husband got a bit defensive of his little princess and sarcastically asked if there was a  no shoe policy  in the park to which the lady replied  yes, there is  ooops! We never knew that   oh well, we learn something new every trip!Managed to get on loads of rides and queueing not too bad (considering it was over a weekend and British Bank Holiday). At one point there was hardly anyone at Casey Jnr so we had 3 goes almost continuously, running round the barriers with no queue at all...great fun! Really quick tunarounds too on Small World, Snow White, Carousel, Railroad, Tea Cups, La Pays des Contes de Fees, Buzz Lightyear and Pirates. Longest queues experienced at Orbitron, Peter Pan and, of course, Big Thunder Mountain. Talking of Big Thunder Mountain, my son started getting really upset about not wanting to go on it, right at the point we were about to get into our seats! Nightmare! However, this lovely cast member kindly offered to stand with my son on the other side where you get off so we could still all go on the ride. What a kind gesture.We went on Autopia for the first time. It was great! Always thought it was just a go round in a circle ride so always avoided it, but it is great fun, and you go on a lovely little journey in a car you steer yourself! We all loved it and went on it twice. My 8 year old did a much better job of steering than me, much to his amusement! Can't believe we have missed out on this little gem for the last 15 years!My husband and I love the Disney Railroad Train which goes all around the park dropping and picking up at stations along the way. It's a chance to sit back and rest you feet for a while while still enjoying the sights and sounds of the park. Once we get on it we tend to stay on it for about an hour just going round again and again. One year we even ate our lunch on it to save a bit of time! It's lovely...a good chance to re charge those batteries!Please remember to check planned ride closures before you book as this could cause disapointment when you arrive. Dumbo was closed while we were there but as least we knew about it beforehand.If you get fed up with rides, there are plently of other things to explore: Alice's Curious Labyrinth (never gets boring), Sleeping Beauty's Castle ( a must for us every trip), Frontierland Fort, Adventure Isle and Les Mysteres Nautilus.One thing we were all very disapointed in was the lack of Characters appearing in the Park. Looking back a few years ago, there were loads out and about, standing around for meet n greets. It gave the place a real magical feel, spotting characters round every corner. Now they just have special areas where you have to queue for ages to see one person ie. Mickey Mouse, Rapunzel or the Princesses in the Pavillion etc. Wish they would bring out the characters...the children love to see them!I cannot really grumble about the Princess Pavillion though as we have been very lucky on that score. Last year, my daughter went in twice and saw Snow White and Belle. This year, she went in three times and manged to see Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty and Ariel. These are all her favourites so she is very lucky to have seen them all without doubling up! Again, I think that was partly down to kind cast members who at the point of us being diverted to our designated room (there are two ways to go to rooms each containing a Princess. Cast members are not allowed to tell you which ones) they asked my daughter if she had been before and if so who she has already seen. Then a subtle and  wink wink  swift change of direction was implmented. So kind. It makes the over an hour long queue in the morning to get your time slots worthwhile!I never thought I would say this though, but we did encounter some very rude cast members too this time. This is not on and really unusual. We experienced about 3 or 4 different encounters which included ignoring us and chatting to colleagues as we stood in front of them, unhelpfulness when asking something and very rude and abrubt attitudes when speaking to us. Where is that  we are here to make your stay here magical  ethos which every cast member should have. I should add though that this is a very small few minority amongst the hundreds of cast members who are lovely and should be very proud.Magic on Parade was OK. It was definately missing some floats and characters from last year I'm sure. Princess Tiana, Prince Naveen, Aladdin, Jasmine, Ariel, Belle, Peter Pan...all missing from Parade. A little disapointing, but made up with the fact that Frozen made an appearance, much to the overwhelming delight of my Frozen obsessed daughter and indeed much of the crowd I think. Queen Elsa made my daughters day by pointing and waving to her as my daughter was wearing her Elsa dress. I had one ecstatic child. The Disney Dreams night time show and fireworks really is great. A shame it is so late at 11pm. Surely 10pm would be OK? My five year old was struggling to stay awake to watch it. Not to be missed though.Now Meals. Would definately recommend the Meal Vouchers. We chose half board plus and had quite a varied selection of restaurants to choose from. This was the first time we have used them and found they made life so much easier. If it was one thing we did not look forward to about a DLP holiday it was the food situation as we found it really stressful trying to find somewhere to eat each day and it was SO costly. Making reservations also helped and it was a big weight off our minds knowing we had our booked tables in place each evening and it was all paid for in advance. My favourite meal was at Walt's. We had a table by the window overlooking Main Street and it was a warm, relaxing and rather sumptuous environment, beautifully furnished with Walt memorabilia. Food was delicious and waiting staff lovely. Definately recommended. We also ate very well at The Steakhouse, Hunter's Grill (at Sequoia Lodge) and Plaza Gardens. Plaza Garden's is a firm favourite of ours. It is all you can eat buffet and does really tasty food with a little more choice for the children unlike a set meal at a table service restaurant (which I have to say is normally burger and fries).The counter service restauants are a slightly different story. Now, how best to describe it: Slow, slow, slow. Don't get me wrong, the food is nice but the staff in these restaurants are just so slow, at the tills and behind the counters. We felt we wasted so much time in these queues, and you have to be careful as they often make mistakes with your order too. We really only needed to use these restaurants for our lunch and knowing that we had a big evening meal booked, we felt we really didn't need much. We actually found that we could buy one adult meal for myself and my husband to share and one childs meal which my two children shared between them. It was more than enough for us especially as we also had vouchers for the Pause Gourmade (Teatime Treat) which is valid from 3pm. We saved a lot of money too. A good counter service restauant we would recommend is Toad Hall   seems a faster service plus very helpful staff and good food.Also beware of unexpected restaurant closures. One day of our stay, at lunchtime, we found that five, yes FIVE, major counter service restaurants were unexpectedly closed with no given explanation or reason. There were open that morning. Very odd. It didn't help that it was a particularly rainy, wet day and people wanted to sit inside. This, of course, then had a knock on effect in that all remaining restaurants which were open got extremely busy. Thank goodness for the Cowboy Cookout in Frontierland. This is a very big resuarant with loads of seating...always good to have as a back up plan if you can't get in anywhere else!Well, I think that's about it...I have waffled on long enough! I hope you have found my review helpful.I know there have been some negatives points here. Overall, we really love DLP and we intend to go back many more times, but I just have this feeling that, at the moment, it could just  do a little better , I feel it just seems to have lost it's way a little with some issues because a lot of the problems could so easily be remedied, I think anyway. I want to say  Look, just pull your socks up a bit and let's get back to those good times a few years ago when the place really was faultless and really did have that 'Where Dreams are Made' magic.

            "Translation error: Nous avons passé une journée complète et 3 demi-jours dans le Magic Kingdom. Nous sommes allés à Walt Disney World en Floride, à Disneyland à Anaheim et à Eurodisney avant que les comparaisons soient inévitables. Nous avons obtenu le guide à l'arrivée et avons pris le programme chronométré pour les défilés. Nous sommes arrivés sur 3 jours à 0800 pour maximiser notre utilisation du début anticipé disponible pour les clients de l'hôtel Disney et nous avons rapidement fait des manèges, y compris Peter Pan, Dumbo, Space Mountain, Buzz Lightyear et Dumbo. Nous avons vu le Spring Street Show chaque jour et avons attrapé la parade 1730 deux fois. Nous avons séjourné pour la clôture spectaculaire une nuit qui est 25 minutes de lampes sensationnelles, des feux d'artifice et de la musique. Il y a aussi des détails sur les attractions non disponibles Indiana Jones et le capitaine EO, pendant que nous y étions. Nous avons essayé d'utiliser les casiers, mais ils ne sont plus disponibles et vous devez quitter le parc et stocker chaque sac pour 3 euros dans le stand des relations avec les clients. Nous avons fait un usage limité de FastPass, mais si cela est utilisé intelligemment, il peut certainement donner la possibilité d'atteindre les grandes attractions au moins une fois par jour. Disponible dans la journée, les files d'attente diminuent (bien que nous ayons noté que de nombreux habitants venaient sur place plus tard dans la journée), et nous avons pu prendre plusieurs trajets sur les pirates des Caraïbes et c'est un petit monde. Nous n'avons eu aucun problème à obtenir notre enfant de 4 ans sur Big Thunder Mountain. Nous n'avions pas non plus de tracas en train de manger notre propre pique-nique dans le parc même à l'ombre du château de Magic. Nous avons fait la queue pour rencontrer Mickey Mouse une très longue attente, mais la peine la rencontre a été très bien faite et nous pourrions prendre nos propres photos et il y avait une attente plus longue pour une machine à sous chronométrée pour le pavillon de la princesse, mais encore la rencontre et la salut a été bien effectuée pour prendre ses propres photographies. Nous étions là à la fin de notre pause scolaire de Pâques et je ne pensais pas que la foule était si grande, le maximum que nous attendions pour une attraction était de 60 minutes, la moyenne globale était dans la région de 20 minutes. Nous avons adoré Big Thunder Mountain et si quelque chose est plus sauvage et plus effrayant qu'auparavant. Malheureusement, il est tombé en panne après avoir fait la queue pendant 45 minutes et avait atteint le dernier tourniquet. Heureusement, 3 de notre groupe avait traversé le tourniquet et, par conséquent, nous avons tous reçu des billets FastPass à utiliser plus tard dans la journée lorsque le trajet était de retour. Les gens immédiatement derrière nous dans la file d'attente n'ont rien !! Dans le cas où le trajet ne serait pas revenu jusqu'au lendemain et est tombé en panne au moment où nous rejoignons la file d'attente! Nous l'avons finalement monté 24 heures plus tard que prévu.Phantom Manor était OK pas particulièrement effrayant et aucun fantôme n'apparaît dans votre char.Les plats des Caraïbes, c'est un trajet bien supérieur à son cousin WDW de toutes les manières. Modélisé après la balade californienne, il est plus long, a deux «gouttes» et des effets de conduite très améliorés. Nous pensons que nous allions être mouillés, mais les éclaboussures à la fin des gouttes ne sont pas trop mauvaises. C'est un petit monde que tout le monde l'aime, bien qu'il soit tombé en panne juste avant que nous n'ayons essayé de l'utiliser une fois et que plusieurs animatrons ne fonctionnaient pas. Cette balade est beaucoup mieux que son cousin WDW. De plus, la musique modifie au moins la clé !!! Peter Pans Flight a déçu un peu alors que les effets d'éclairage semblaient un peu en sourdine.Casey Junior une grande petite balade qui évite les files d'attente majeures dès le début en raison de son emplacement légèrement `` hors des sentiers battus ''. Les petits adoreront son type de montagnes russes doux. Un véritable succès avec nos plus jeunes. Le livre de story roule délicieux en bateau autour de modèles détaillés de l'écurie Disney des fonctionnalités animées accompagnées de motifs des scores musicaux. Alices Curious Labryinth Fun! Mad Hatters Tea tasses excellentes pas aussi vite que je m'en souviens. Je ne suis pas sûr que le levier monte et descendre fonctionne vraiment. Très coloré. Le tournage interactif sur Targets est très amusant et fonctionne vraiment. Autopie notre attente la plus longue sur une heure par heure de ma vie, je ne reviendrai jamais !!! Je ne comprends pas pourquoi c'est populaire, c'est bruyant, sale et franchement ennuyeux. Mais ma famille n'est pas d'accord sur Orbitron rien de spécial. Encore une fois, je ne sais pas que les leviers d'altitude fonctionnent car ils sont censés. Évitez à moins qu'il ne pleuve.

            "Translation error: I wasnt going to write a review but after reading some of the terrible ones here i had to stick up for Disneyland : )We have just returned from a 5 day break, 17th   21st feb and it was our second visit. We stayed at the Santa Fe this time and we are 2 adults and 2 children (aged 5 and 7).We had a fantastic time and cannot fault anything!!I booked direct during the 30 days of yes and we drove via le shuttle with an over night stay in Canterbury on the way there to break up the journey and allow us to catch a nice early train without having to get up too early.Breakfast, this complaint bugs me! Its continental, you are not going to get sausages and bacon, if you want that then go self catering. Yes its ham, cheese and rolls but theres also toast, fruit, yogurt, croissant , pain au chocolat, nutella, jam, honey and plenty of coffee, tea, orange juice...what more do you want inc in the price? Yes the que for the toast machine gets long   simple...have something else... a few days without toast isnt going to kill anyone and the ham rolls are very good : ) Yes, it gets busy   there are alot of hungry people staying there BUT people are always leaving and freeing up tables and food is always restocked so calm down. we ate at 8.30 on our first day then changed to a later time as the little ones needed the extra sleep and we didnt feel we needed the extra hours in the park with 5 days there.Food, personally i dont think its that expensive. look before you go, plan based on your budget and take sandwich bags. Its true that yes most people make rolls at breakfast and take them into the park and we did this too incase the kids got peckish before we wanted to eat...we ended up snacking on them in the evening though as breakfast was so filling they werent needed. Menus can be found online at sites like dlrpmagic. Last year we used the meal plan and i wouldnt do this again, we found just buying what we wanted when we wanted worked much better. we ate at Planet hollywood, King ludwigs, mcdonalds, Hippo (in val d europe) and pizza planet. The food isnt out of this world, its fast its a theme park! If you want to eat on a budget go for counter service or McDs personally we love planet hollywood and pizza plant, although basic, is a must will young children   ours loved it. McD is the same price as home but a happy meal comes with fruit or yogurt and whilst we were there there was also a free dvd promo on. Ques, we went in feb half term. its also a french holiday and ques were not bad at all. the longest was 30 mins for thunder mountain but we could have used a fast pass on that. You get access to fast pass with your hotel so use it. Again though, this is a theme park and like Alton towers there will be ques...if you need to then use the extra hours, plan your routes etc or better still just enjoy your break   its a magical place. The biggest que we saw was to see the princesses and this was 75 mins so that one would be worth doing nice and early if possible. Space mountain regularly has a que less than 5 mins long so if its more go back later.Characters were everywhere!! Last year it was a bit difficult to see them with the crowds but this time round they have a nice que and a member of staff letting you know when the que is closed. the best place is around by the disney junior show in the studios park and at the top of main street in the main park   we saw LOADS!The disney junior show in english fills fast, its currently at 1pm and doors open 25 mins before   get there for then as theres a preshow thing with sofia and jake which the kids loved.The park is not run down, whilst we were there there were staff going around cleaning the chewing gum off the floor and i didnt see any cigarette ends. Look around you, the attention to detail is amazing! Go into the castle and make sure you go in the basement to see the dragon too : )The staff are lovely, they are friendly and helpful but at the least try and say please, thankyou and hello in THEIR language   its just good manners. The only rude people we encountered were sadly British.One train stop away or a few mins drive is Val d Europe, a nice big shopping centre with supermarkets and restaurants too   this is worth a visit to restock drinks etc for the room.Kettles, i can honestly say we have never stayed in a French hotel with tea making facilities...this isnt something only Disney do. We take coffee with us and a mug and borrow a kettle from the information desk   this year it was free with no deposit but last year at the cheyenne we left a deposit for this so just check   they also have tea baskets with tea bags etc you can buy.the sante fe is also very close to the esso garage where wine is from 4 euro a bottle so worth popping there if youd like a drink in the room.Shops, i also didnt find these too expensive   it depends what you are buying! minnie mouse bag with removable minnie mouse toy for 22 euros seems fab to me, a mug for 6 euros and there are plenty of little things for 5   10 euro if you want to just get the kids something small. ours loved this little tins of sweets for 1 euro (they are little but its something and then treat them to a big gift on your final day) Every shop has its own offer on a red sign by the till...buy  this  for half price if you spend 20 30 euros...its worth checking these out, we got the doll our little one wanted by getting the few bits hubby wanted from the shop with the doll on offer.drinks, these can be costly! The best tip we got? KING LUDWIGS HAPPY HOUR!! 5 7.30pm 50% off beer, soda and wine....we recommend the litre glass of beer with a shot of grenadine in it : ) its located by planet hollywood.if you eat at King ludwigs you get 20% off at the rainforest cafe and visa versa   if you wont use it give it to someone else thats heading that way (they need your receipt from the other restaurant too) might as well save someone some money.we paid   432 for hotel and park tickets inc breakfast and took 480 euros with us, this was for food, drinks and gifts...we only put 3 tshirts on our card in planet hollywood   everything else was paid for with the cash we took and that inc treats for the kids and a few beers too. It doesnt have to be expensive.If driving keep 21.70 for the toll ... they do take cards too though   its worth it to drive on those roads...no traffic, no issues just a pleasant drive.The biggest tip i can give is to embrace it. See the magic, be a kid and take things on the shoulder.....if someone pushes so what? if theres a line dont moan about it. you are making magical memories...the kids wont remember the man that pushed in   they remember mickey mouse rubbing noses with them on the parade! Have a fab time!! ooo and say hello to the man thats painted as a white statue outside the park, he`s been there for years and he`s a nice guy. Pop a euro in his tin for a kiss on the hand a picture and a chat : ) --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"

            "Translation error: This past weekend, myself and four friends visited Disneyland Paris. The following is my letter of complaint that I have had to forward on to the company.Dear Sir Madam,I am writing to complain and bring your attention to a number of issues I experienced whilst in your Disneyland Paris resort this weekend (8th November to 11th November 2013). Me, and all of my party, are huge supporters of The Walt Disney Company. This year alone we have visited the parks in Orlando, Anaheim and Paris, happily spending thousands of pounds and we have never had any problem until this past weekend.Our weekend started at the Davy Crockett Ranch, which was perfect for us and in which we only experienced a couple of minor issues. Firstly, we had been told that our cabin would be decorated for birthday celebrations, however this never materialised. This was quite disappointing when it had been promised by the reception staff. Secondly, our premium plus cabin never included the hairdryer or cleaning kit that is said to be included on your website. When we rang up reception about this they told us we had to collect them from the front desk. After driving to the reception and queuing in a horrific queue, we were then told we needed to pay a deposit for the items (none of us had brought any money to the front desk because this wasn   t explained on the phone) and were turned away. We didn   t have time to get money and queue again since it was eating into our time at the parks, and thus members of our party had to go to the parks in 1 degree Celsius temperatures with damp hair. Over the course of the weekend there were numerous problems within the two parks. Firstly we were extremely disappointed there was no big switch on of the lights for the Christmas Weekend. We had seen advertisements all over the TV in the UK saying that the weekend we had booked was a huge Christmas celebration, and expected more of an event than we got. When we arrived half of the lights and decorations were already up, and so on the Sunday (first day of Christmas) nothing was an impressive surprise as we had seen it over the 2 days prior. We expected a grand switch on of the lights down Main Street USA the Christmas tree, instead of a half finished parade on the Saturday which had the dancers props falling apart and no Christmas lights to accompany it. Furthermore, when we booked our half board meal plan with the stay we were assured we would have a    variety of restaurants    to choose from. This was definitely not the case. There was one full service restaurant available in Walt Disney Studios, and a handful in the Disney Park. Out of all of these barely any were available to eat in past 5pm, so our choices for dinner were extremely limited. It was nothing like the dining plans we had received in the other two parks earlier on this year and was very disappointing. We dined at the Silver Spur Steakhouse on Sunday afternoon (since nowhere was available for dinner) and had, to be quite honest, the most disappointing meal I can recall to date. We made reservations for 3:30pm so we could see the 4:45pm parade. A rude waitress seated us at 3:50pm, and our order was taken at 4pm. It was put through the till at 4:10pm, our soft drinks didn   t come until 4:20pm and our wine didn   t come until 4:25pm. By this point we had almost been in the restaurant an hour and hadn   t even seen our starters, which were cold salads prawn cocktails. We called over our waiter and asked how long the food would be, and asked to speak to the manager. An extremely rude woman named Marlene then came over, and shrugged her shoulders when we asked how long the food would be. She was the most unwelcoming cast member I have ever met. We then said that if she couldn   t tell us how long our food would be we would be leaving, as by this point we had 20 minutes to eat three courses and get into position for the parade. We made a compromise with Marlene that if we stayed for the meal she would reimburse our half board meal vouchers as an apology so we could have a meal on our final day (Monday). After she left, our starters came almost instantly. 3 out of 5 of our party went to see the parade, as it was the only time we would be able to see it, and two of us stayed at the table eating our starters. At 4:45pm our mains were brought over, without our starters being cleared away, without anyone asking how the starters were, when the servers could clearly see that our table was half empty. I explained the situation to him, and asked him to keep the food warm in the kitchen and understood it was our fault if the steak we had ordered would be dry because of this. He rolled his eyes and huffed at us before returning to the kitchen. At this point, we saw that the waiters were discussing our table mere metres away from us, and since one person in our party spoke fluent French, we knew what they were discussing was something to be kept until the cast members were backstage. When our bill arrived at the end of the meal, I asked Marlene what we do about getting our vouchers for the meal the next day. She then shrugged once again, and said that she wasn   t willing to give them to us since we stayed for the meal and    lied    about the date we were leaving. She was extremely rude to us, accused us of being liars when we had told her one member of our party was leaving on the Sunday evening but the other 4 were staying until Monday afternoon, and threatened to call security on us if we didn   t pay the remainder of the bill and leave. We even said we   d provide our hotel booking information to show our departure date but she shook her hand and said she didn   t want to know. I was absolutely disgusted at how we   d been treated by the staff in this restaurant. To avoid confrontation, we paid the monies owed and went to City Hall to file a complaint. While we were there, we got told that Marlene had said we were twenty minutes late to our reservation (when we were five minutes early) and again, accused us of lying about our departure date. Due to this, nothing was resolved at City Hall and another hour of our evening was taken up writing a summary of the event. All weekend the majority of the staff we met were unhappy, unwelcoming and unhelpful     not something you expect when you pay the money you do to Disney to experience the world famous Disney magic. We encountered rude staff when asking to pin trade, throwing pins down on desks and walking away when we gave them pins that they    didn   t want    and barely received any birthday wishes when walking around the park even though 4 of the 5 of us were wearing stickers saying we were celebrating. Very unlike Orlando where you can barely walk 5 metres without a    Happy Birthday Princess!    off someone. There were a distinct lack of characters in the parks for meet and greets, and the ones that were out had very limited times so it made it difficult to fit them in among a busy day. Again, we found this very different to Orlando and California. While we were there, the amount of rides which were closed down due to technical problems was disgusting. To name a few, Tower of Terror wasn   t working on Saturday and half of Sunday, there was no sound on Rock    n    Rollercoaster on Friday or Saturday when we went (which is extremely disappointing when the ride is based on Aerosmith   s music), Crush   s Coaster was down on Saturday and Sunday, Toy Soldiers Parachute Drop was down on Sunday, the Studio Tram Tour was down on Sunday, and had been down on Saturday (even though we understand the Saturday was due to maintenance) and Phantom Manor broke down 3 times while we were on it, making us late to watch Magical Christmas Wishes on Main Street USA. If you look at the above, that is the majority of Walt Disney Studios which was down over the weekend. Since we only had one full day in each of the parks, this was very disappointing. We understand that things happen on rides which are out of the control of the cast members; however we also know that whenever any problems happen in Orlando or Anaheim they are rectified in record time. This was not the case in Paris. Finally, the overall appearance of the park was disappointing. A lot of the areas looked like they could do with a clean (mould on the walls by the travelators into the park, dirty looking signs, trash on the floor in the dark rides etc.) and it didn   t portray the Disney look in the slightest. My experience this weekend was one that I shall not forget in a hurry and I will not be returning to Disneyland Paris until it is owned and operated by The Walt Disney Company and is at the standard of the other resorts. This weekend my party and I feel like we visited a theme park, and did not feel as though I visited the Disneyland that I have done many times in the past. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"

            "Translation error: We're a family with young children so it seemed like a great idea. But from the moment we arrived at the airport to the bitter end it was endlessly terrible. There is no signage when you get to Charles de Gaulle airport to help you at all. So that was a bad start but we worked it out.When we arrived at the train station, again nothing to explain what to do now, but again with three small children and suitcases we wandered round the multiple bus stops and worked it out.The buses come every 20 minutes, so when ours arrived the huge queue of teenagers piled onto it, leaving us and about 30 other people standing there to await this bus to go all the way to the hotel and come back to get us, we'd been up since 4am to get here and the kids were starting to get very tired etc. But with the prospect of getting to the hotel and back to the park we could cope with it.We finally just jumped in a cab and got to our Hotel, The Magic Circus. I stood with one person in front of me and one person behind the counter for 45 mins waiting to check in. Meanwhile several other disgruntled guests came down to complain that the desk were handing out multiple keys to the same room, including one family who'd had a stranger walk in on his children.By now my kids are going spare and the hotel is doing nothing to speed up the check in process at 3pm in the afternoon. You would think they might have guessed people would arrive around that time.After an hour or so we are checking in and they haven't got my booking, but give me keys to a room and we will 'sort out the issue later'.We get to the room change and head back out to wait for the packed bus to take us back to the park.Upon arrival i head off to buy tickets and am directed to an office where I'm told that it's cheaper to buy annual passports than tickets for all of us for 3 days. I'm also told to buy a certain level of passport otherwise there are 'lock out days' that we won't be able to get in on. So i pay 600 euros for these annual Disney passports for the whole family.They tell me when we head into the park I have to get the passports validated before 6pm. FIne i send the rest of the family off to actually see something in the park whilst i go to get the passports validated.I wait 40 mins in a queue before being told that the whole family must be here to get the passports validated, plus as i have my youngest child in a pram i have to leave him there as we is not allowed up the 2 steps to get to the desk to sort out the passports. It's a health and safety issue.So i have to go and search the park and drag my tired and upset family back to the passport office, queue for another 20 mins before they finally see us, take pictures and validate these Eurodisney passports.Ok so we're finally free to look around the park, we've missed the parade, the kids are in tears, my wife's furious with me because i've been away the whole time...But we decide to make a fresh start of it and go from here.Every ride has at least 60 minute queues, some 90 mins. Even to get a snack or bottle or water we were queueing for 10 to 15 minutes.We've had enough for the day so decide to head home on the horrific bus and go to bed and start again tomorrow. A complete waste of time and money so far.I try to buy the kids an ice cream but the staff treat you with such contempt that i thought i must have been in the wrong area, five people behind the counter chatting to each other whilst i stood in front of them trying to catch their eye, when i asked where i should order the ice cream he just scoffed gave his friend the 'who's this idiot' look and said 'here of course'. We go back to the hotel for some awful food, and to sleep.Day 2, get up and head to the park. Only to be told that the EuroDisney passports we had been sold yesterday for 600 euros were not valid for the rest of our stay as they were Lock Out days.I nearly hit the roof, I found someone who worked there and looked like he actually knew what he was doing. I explained that we had been missold these very expensive EuroPassports and that we just wanted to leave now and get a refund.  No  Disney doesn't do refunds.He called someone on the walky talky and sorted it that we could get into the park. Told us just to go to the entry point and explain, they would then check the files and let us in.We walk over to the ticket point...  It's a lock out day you can't come in  i know it's a lock out day but it's on the system to allow us in  we can't access the system. You'll have to go all the way over to the other side of the park to get someone else to check it By now I was close to tears, the rest of the family way past that point.We trek over to the other side of the park have the whole conversation again with someone else who now checks the files and lets us in.FINALLY WE ARE IN!!But every ride is again 60 to 90 minute waits, to eat at a restaurant you have to book (no one tells you this) even the awful fast food is a 45 minute wait.They have given us a couple of passes to go up through the exit and get straight on a ride. I take the kids on 2 rides, we queue 50 mins for a bad hamburger...and leave.The contempt of the staff, the queues, the borderline inedible food, the terrible atmosphere where people think nothing of yanking your pram out the way to get past, the start to finish nightmare that this holiday was has actually made it hard to write this review.I still get upset when i think of the fact that my family's one holiday of the year was the most appalling experience possible. EuroDisney looks great, but it is the worst holiday you could ever wish upon your worst enemy.Of course not everyone would have this bad a time there, but be warned. This was a very expensive mistake and has ruined the Disney brand for us and our kids. Their movies have such care, attention and quality, but EuroDisney destroys that all. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"

            "Translation error: We booked a three night trip to visit Eurodisney with our 4 and 5 year old children. We stayed at the Explorers hotel, which was the perfect place for our family (see the separate review).However, we were bitterly disappointed by the 2 day Eurodisney experience. We arrived on day one around 10.15 and queued to bag check for ten minutes. Little did we realise this would be the shortest queue of the day!As Explorers isn't a Disney hotel, we couldn't take advantage of the earlier opening times, nor were the rides aimed at my children's age group included in the Fastpass scheme.We started by going around the Sleeping Beauty castle at my 4 year old's request. There was no queue. We walked around and it was very pretty and gave good views from the upper floor which enabled us to get our bearings a bit more. As we exited, the ubiquitous gift shop offering princess dresses was situated outside. The price for a Rapunzel princess dress sized for a 5 year old was 70 euros! We then went on the carousel (30 min wait) and then into the Pinnochio ride which was advertised at 20 min ride, getting to the front of the queue in 40 minutes! Half way around the queue, my youngest needed the toilet, so I ducked out the queue, leaving my other half with the other child, and we went to use possibly the dirtiest toilets I have used in a very long time (remember, this was only 11.30) situated around the back of the ride. We were able to rejoin the family in the queue. My children found part of the ride quite scary and my daughter proclaimed that she really hated the ride when we got off!So, keen to get the day back on track, we decided to go into Adventureland to grab lunch. Forgive me for including the following experience, but I think it demonstrates the poor customer service very well:We visited the Cafe Agrabah and arrived just before noon as we wanted to ensure we got there early in case we needed to wait. Already there was a couple with a young child in a pushchair who had already made a reservation. The greeter started by stating that the restaurant was not yet open. We said we would wait. She then said  there are no tables until 2.30 . OK, I said, we will book and come back.  I can't take a booking until noon . I replied,  It's noon now!   Oh , she replied,  Is it?  The other couple said  Is it possible for us to go inside?   We don't open until noon  was the reply.  It's noon now , said the couple.  You need to book as we are fully booked .  We have booked  replied the couple.  For what time?  said the greeter.  Noon , replied the couple.  I will have to check  said the greeter who then disappeared, leaving her colleague, when queried where his colleague was, he just said  I don't work on this desk . Flabbergasted, we left the poor couple waiting to see if they would ever be allowed into the restaurant.We then decided, as clearly a buffet lunch was going to be too difficult, we would just get a snack.So, we called in at the Hakuna Matata fast food joint. There were massive queues and, despite it now being 12.25, it was clear they hadn't started serving lunch!So, we joined the queue to at least pay for the order. There was very limited choice   basically it was glorified chicken nuggets and chips with a salad option for the vegetarians. The children's menu didn't include fries   just the choice between 8 cherry tomatoes in a bag or plain boiled rice. We then waited 15 minutes to actually get our food and wished we hadn't bothered. We ended up paying 38 euros for two adult meals and two children's meals. The content of the adult meal was five 8cm x 4 cm pieces of breaded chicken and a few serrated slices of deep fried potato plus a diet coke, the children's meal was two 8cm x 3cm pieces of breaded chicken (unseasoned) then one child had 8 cherry tomatoes and the other had rice. They also got a yoghurt drink and apple juice. The wrong juice was supplied   we had to correct the order, and the child meal with rice wasn't supplied   so had to be corrected.The inside seating area was filthy and dark. A memorable meal for all the wrong reasons, we ate quickly and left. The competition have  No Worries  with this one. We went up the Swiss family robinson treehouse (queue kept moving so not bad) which gave good views of the park but left with the youngest declaring  This is boring, can we do something good now .We found the Pirate area and were much relieved to discover two little play parks to occupy the children. They then wanted to go on the impressive looking Pirate ship on the water   but it wasn't open to the public!We ventured into the caves and eventually queued up for 45 minutes to go on the Pirates of the Caribbean ride which the children enjoyed (although queuing in the dark was a little frightening for my youngest).Returning to Fantasyland , we joined the mammoth queue on the Dumbo ride. This little cracker took 80 minutes to get onto the 2 minute ride. However, we were kept entertained by a large number of the queuing punters having a row over two women with children elbowing their way through the queue. There was a round of applause when the ride attendant told them to leave without going on the ride. There was a pungent aroma of urine in the queue   we discovered the reason for this later!We followed this with an ice cream   which was absolutely rock hard! I have never seen such over frozen ice cream ever! We wondered if this was simply the booth we had chosen   but we visited another booth the next day and it was the same.We decided to visit the It's a Small World ride, which I had visited in Florida, so knew what to expect. The children loved it and the 20 minute ride wasn't too onerous. We ended our day in Fantasyland to go on the Autopia ride. The queue advertised 45 minutes, but ended up being 65 minutes. Just within sight of the end of the queue, both children needed the toilet, so we had to forego the ride having queued for all that time..... Now we know why the Dumbo ride was pongy   parents didn't dare step out of the queue to take their children to the toilet!The following day, we got there a little earlier   and was greeted by longer queues for the bag check. We started by racing around to the car ride we had failed to make the day before, but found the queue as long as we had left it the day before! We duly queued for an hour and got to go on the two minute ride! We did the Nautilus walkthrough attraction (no queue) and then saw the Captain EO which the grown ups enjoyed but children found a bit scary. We decided to get on the Disney train to go around to Frontierland for lunch   big mistake. We didn't get on the first train, so had to wait for the next one which was being taken from a siding. When it arrived, was covered in soot which got on everyone's clothes and was moving slowly (until a driver got out of the train and sprinkled sand on the tracks to give it traction!) We abandoned our lunch plan, and decided to go to the Disney Studio Park for lunch. We arrived and had decided we would just grab a hot dog. There were three people in front of us in the queue, yet it still took 20 minutes to be served! The kids were complaining about being hungry and when I got to the front of the queue, I was greeted with the news that there were only three hotdogs left! The time was 1.30pm.So, now understanding why other guests in our hotel were smuggling rolls out at breakfast time, we abandoned the queue and found another stand and walked away victorious with four cold hot dogs, two cokes, two juices and two packets of salt and vinegar crisps (no ketchup left!) Another 38 euros...We aimed for Toy story playland as it looked in the guide like it would be more suitable for our children's age group. Sadly, this wasn't the case. We went on the slinky dog ride (30 minute wait) and the Flying Carpet ride (45 minute wait) but the 90 minute wait on the other rides put us off! We then watched the Stars and Cars parade of 14 cars at 4pm. The children, seemingly completely underwhelmed, said  Please can we go back to the hotel now and have a swim!?!  So we left!I had previously been to Disneyland Florida with a friend and her children, but went with an open mind. I was expecting a lot of rides to be unsuitable for the children as they are young and haven't been on rides before. I am used to the concept of the ridiculous queues (although Florida seem to make it more enjoyable). I was not expecting great quality food. I also knew we were unlikely to see the Disneyland Park parade or evening show as they are simply too late for the children (7pm and 10pm respectively). I am not afraid of paying the price for a good service and quality product   however, in my opinion, Eurodisney offers neither. As other reviewers have also noted   Eurodisney completely lacks the Disney magic experience that usually makes it palatable to pay the high prices. We won't be back. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"

            "Translation error: Visited in August, not by design but because we were driving to the Dordogne and thought it would be the most efficient (cheapest!) way to squeeze Disneyland into their childhoods without paying   2k for some sort of package with flights.First off, this place is not easy to find if you are coming from the north. We drove from Calais down the A1 and there were no signposts at all. I tried using online descriptions of how to find it and these were no use at all as the roads seemed to have changed name. Frantic map reading saw us skirting the perimeter fence at CDG airport and edging south via a series of small towns and u turns. Come on Paris, sign this place up!Stayed at the magic circus hotel, which was fine (see separate review). Arrived at the park on a Sunday afternoon at about 2pm. We had a pass for the studios next door too so went to see that first. Long queues for rides that last about a minute   so disappointing, we got on the slinky dog ride after a 40 minute wait. Elder daughter got on the parachute ride after a much shorter queue by going on it alone. Total of two rides then.Saw the animagique show, which was very good but pretty short (20 mins?). Saw a few characters, even our kids didn't recognise some of them. Other kids queuing up for autographs with some sort of book they had purchased in the shop. Spanish kids pushing and shoving.For dinner we ate at the rainforest cafe outside. It was good food (enormous salad!) but hugely overpriced, as was every other cafe. Kids liked the cafe though with its thunder and lightening and general ambience. Over to the disneyland park in time for the 7pm parade. Got there at 6.40 and bagged a good spot just inside the entrance. It's true that people start bagging spots earlier but there's plenty of space. Beware other people muscling in on the place you have saved by pushing their kids forwards. Over enthusiastic Disney staff enforcing rules all along the pavement. Kids with a centimetre of sandal protruding off the pavement urged to move back. Same staff crouching in front of kids and blocking their view. Quite a spectacle in itself. The parade was great. I believe it gets cancelled if it rains. Stayed up for the 11pm dreams show. This was really excellent but hard for the kids to get a good view. Again lots of pushing and shoving. Everyone sits on the pavement waiting for it to begin and then stands up just beforehand. I am sure these problems would be eliminated if it were compulsory to remain seated. Several very thoughtless people in the vicinity including people who arrived at the last minute (one wearing a huge Stetson and completely blocking my daughters view); another with a toddler on her back who pushed in front of me just before her toddler put his foot into my drink. Yes, people really stand that close!Next day we saw sleeping beauty's castle, which was well done. Queued for absolutely ages for the carousel (seriously, queuing for an hour for a standard carousel...come on Disney, this is crap!). 1 hour 15 for the dumbo ride and 1 hour 30 for the train ride. None of the rides was worth the queue. Nothing to entertain the children while waiting, miserable experience.The 'fast pass' system confused me. As an idiots guide   when you enter the park you will be given a fast pass ticket. If you enter in the afternoon there may be none left. The fast pass entitles you to book a slot on a particular ride. So you go to that ride and you enter your fast pass and this gives you a pre arranged time at which you can return and join a much shorter queue. However, once you have done so, you cannot use your fast pass again until that pre arranged ride has been completed.So for example, if you enter at 10.30 and you 'book' a ride for 1.30 2pm then you cannot book another ride until after you've been on this first one. You do not get a choice of time. People booking rides using their fast pass at 1.30pm were being given slots at 9.45pm as these were the first available. This explains why the fast passes run out in the afternoon. The fast pass sounds like a good idea but in August you might only get one ride out of it (as we did   the Peter Pan ride, which was great).Had lunch with the princesses at the auberge. Bill came to    237 for the four of us. Apparently the wine used to be included but it isn't now (I had one glass!). This was by far the best thing about the whole trip. Kids loved it. The adult food was gorgeous but the choice of children's food was strange and includes a salmon mousse starter with no other choice (perhaps French children have more sophisticated palates....mine wouldn't touch this). You really have to book this in advance at peak times. We booked it by phoning disneyland Paris reservations directly. You can hire buggies but I don't think you can take them out of the park. They are basically chairs on shopping trolleys and don't look comfortable. I borrowed one from a friend for our 4 year old but if this had failed I was planning to spend   40 on a second hand one on eBay as it was cheaper than hiring one, more comfortable and I would have been able to take it out of the park.Try the shopping centre up the road for simple food. It's about 10 minutes in the car around the ring road or you can take the train from right outside the park. Beware this centre has height restrictions of 2.1 metres in place, especially around the petrol station. We measured 2.2 m with our top box and were unable to access the petrol station despite asking for help. In all, our children have happy memories of Disneyland Paris but they were ready to leave after lunch and hated the queues. We can say we've done it. We probably won't bother with Florida on the back of this but will take them bear spotting in Yosemite for a fraction of the price instead. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"

            "Translation error: We travelled as a group of 3 adults, 1 teen, 1 child age 5, and a 1 yr old. We booked 6 months in advance through Thomson. As we had to take this trip in school holidays it cost us a fortune just for a 2 night stay (could have got a weeks holiday abroad 4* all inc for what we paid!!) . All the deals advertised on TV just did not work for us as we were not going to stay at Davy Crockett's or spend more money staying another 1 or 2 nights just to try and get a free night stay... Our dates did not coincide with any of Disney's offers which was frustrating, disappointing and misleading! The best offer we got was free hotel & park tickets for the 5 yr old and a free trip overall for the 1 yr old as we didnt have to book a Eurostar seat for her. We were all looking forward to seeing the magic kingdom, especially the 5 yr old who understood she was going to see the castle, princesses,   Micky & Minnie. As adults we had not seen a Disneyland park since we were kids so just walking down Main Sreet again, and seeing the pink castle at the end of it instantly brought those feelings back. We went at the end of July 2013, just at the start of school holidays. Weather was good during the day and not too hot walking around, just about right. We arrived at Marne la Vallee Chessy at 2pm but went via shuttle bus straight to our hotel which was Hotel Santa Fe. The shuttle buses are included in the cost of the trip and are directly opposite the train station. there is a bus every 10 minutes. It takes less than 10 mins to reach this hotel. We needed to freshen up after our 3 hour trip from St Pancras so did not reach the parks until 4pm. As soon as we arrived at Disneyland we headed straight to City Hall. Two of the children in our family group have learning difficulties and are registered to a doctor & paediatrician in the UK. Before travelling to Disney we found out through a friend ( yes, Thomson didn't think to ask us about this when we booked!) that children who are physically disabled or who have various types of behavioural or learning difficulties can apply for a priority pass. We knew that this would really help make our 3 day visit a much easier and better one so we arranged for doctors letters 2 weeks before the trip and then presented these to City Hall staff in order to be granted priority passes for the entire stay. This was an easy process! If you have a child with a disorder, mental illness or other disability I would highly recommend that you pursue seeking an official letter of proof before you travel so that you can ask for a free priority pass (look on Disneyland Paris website for details) This meant that while others had to join lengthy queues on any ride or attraction, the longest queue we had was around 10 minutes. We had 2 of these passes which meant that an adult must accompany each child on a ride (or they can not go on it), and on some rides such as Casey Jr Train or Small World we could all go on as a family if we booked a time slot. The best thrill ride there without a doubt is Space Mountain: Mission 2 in Discoverylsnd. We had trouble with our priority passes on this one for some reason, the young lad on the entry gate didn't believe that the passes we had were ours! Apparently some people were not using them correctly and abused the system just to avoid a queue. After much annoyance we were allowed on the ride. The ride was awesome! I think the passes will eventually be changed to incorporate photo ID. Casey Jr was a pleasant train ride for all the family, Small World was just as I remembered it! We also went on Indiana Jones roller coaster, which is just average and not a lot to do with the actual theme! Big Thunder Mountain is still good! Phantom Manor was dull and I'm glad we did not need to queue for that! We missed Pirates of the Caribbean as we had walked around so much and just didn't know where it was so we lost interest in looking any further.We had a a junk food tea in Casey's Corner, I think it was    15 for a meal deal (ouch!) and still felt hungry afterwards! We only did that because its right on Main St and we wanted to get a good view of the 7pm parade. Everyone lines the street sitting down waiting for the parade and the dumb thing is that when it starts they all stand up ! Meaning that if you are a row behind, you won't get a good view! Luckily we did! The 20th parade was good, lots of characters but not every character you could think of, which is a home as I think there should have been a few more. Opposite Casey's is the Gibson Girl. They do nice sweet things including hot pancakes with cream or ice cream. These were superb!! About    5.99 but I could not resist this treat!On Main St there's loads of places to eat... Loads of places to shop ! The Disney Celebration train also goes by during the day but we never knew the times so we never got to see it properly! As other reviews have said, there are not enough characters walking around, this is kind of true! We did see a few but not enough to stop and take a photo. There were times when there would be one character such as Mickey or Jesse but this of course would draw in a large crowd, no wait your turn system, a bit disorganised! Too many pushy parents! We missed out on Peter Pan's Flight as it was closed when we tried to go on and then we didn't get the chance to try again. The buzz lightyear ride in discovery land was dull, but I guess more for little kids than teens or adults. Autopia was great fun! We went on this the most, about 3 times at least. The 2013 Disney Dreams show is very good (ends in Sep). It is very well executed and gives a great feeling of the Disney magic! But... It is on too late! 11pm is just too late if you have been wandering around all day from 9 or 10am. By the time the show ends there are crowds of people heading towards the gate as the park is closing.. Then you will have to wait for your shuttle bus as everyone has the same idea! Unfortunately the first night we waited to watch the 11pm show it started raining just before the start, this caused hundreds of visitors to leave the outdoor areas such as Main St and panic like it was something worse than a light rain shower! We ended up leaving our good viewing spot for the show, got separated into 2 groups and spent the next hour in shelter and looking out for eachother in the crowds! Missed the Dreams show because of it but you can't help the weather. We watched it the next night but our viewing spot wasn't the best! I'd say overall we had a fab time at Disneyland Paris. Yes, it's expensive in every way but it is a pleasant experience and we would like to go again one day although I think going back to Orlando would be our top choice next. Outside of school holidays is of ourselves best because queues are smaller and prices are lower! --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"

            "Translation error: Please read all of this review, it   s written as a parent who went to DLRP with open eyes, not a grown adult with the mentality of a six year old. We paid a lot of money for our stay there (my wife, I and our 6 year old daughter) and there are many things wrong with the resort than are right. I don   t know where to start, so I   ll get the obvious out of the way first, but I   ll come back to one point. Firstly, queues are going to be a given and they are going to be long, end of. Secondly, prices, anybody who goes to DLRP and doesn   t (or even does) expect it to be expensive is deluding themselves and there   s no point in complaining about it, that   s the way it is, end of, get used to it, they want your money, and you   ll give it to them (you already have).OK, the gripes. Firstly, 99.9% of the staff look miserable, bored, and sullen and can be rude. They really haven   t taken on the Disney customer service ethos. It   s difficult to find one who smiles (I saw two or three), they don   t try to make eye contact or speak English, which reminds me of another point thank you. They are there doing their job, they get paid minimum wage and generally give minimum service. The two we had good experiences of went out of their way to help us, and we were very grateful for their help, but they were the exceptions rather than the norm. Secondly, the park looks old, dated, tatty, and a bit worn out. OK, it   s been open 21 years, but it doesn   t look like some of the park hasn   t had a lick of paint since it was opened. The toilets show the signs of well used toilets, often smelly and wet underfoot (I can   t speak for the ladies obviously), but regular checks seem to be lacking.Thirdly, DLRP apparently has a    No smoking    rule in the park, this is woefully disregarded and completely unenforced. Why grown people want to walk around a theme park designed for the enjoyment of children either holding a burning cigarette at child head height or waving it about, or even whilst waiting in the queues, is really beyond me, if you NEED to smoke, go out of the park and do it there for Gods sake, we observed cigarette ends everywhere, and I mean everywhere, it looks disgusting, we even saw children playing with them, which ok, is the parents fault for not stopping them, but if they weren   t there in the first place, problem solved. The smoking issue also cast a dark shadow on our holiday when one of our neighbours across the channel waved his cigarette around, burning our daughters brand new Disney toy, this might seem trivial, but for one thing it cost 26euros and was ruined, and secondly, if she hadn   t been holding the toy the way she was, his cigarette would have burned its way into her eye. Smoking in such a crowded park is an issue DLRP needs to address. Fourthly, queues (again) and rides, DLRP seems to have taken    how to make things not be seen    lessons from the SAS, short queues are deceiving, the real queue is generally hidden from view round a corner until you are actually committed to be in it. The times shown are completely inaccurate, for example, the waiting time for the    Tower of terror    was shown to be 35mins, when in fact it was probably twice that long, the    fast pass    system for that ride had been closed, so it was decided that there was no time for it. The queue for    Crush   s Coaster    ride was 80mins long, again too long for a six year old to stand in. DLRP needs to put some sort of entertainment in place for the long queues, it was suggested in another review that some video screens showing cartoons in the longer queues might be the way forward and I agree. The rides seemed to be poorly maintained, (   Thunder mountain    broke down while we were there and this is apparently a regular thing), and often a waste of time, we queued for near on an hour to go on the    Cars rally    ride, half of the ride   s cars were out of operation, and the safety checks for the ride actually lasted longer than the ride itself. The Carousel de Lancelot, although there was no queue, only lasted a turn and a half, again nowhere near as long as the safety checks. You need to be paying attention if there are any announcements, they will always be in French first and rushed English second (if at all), the first attraction we went through, the spoken parts were completely in French, luckily the queen of hearts really only said one thing, so we could guess, but our six year old daughter? We also took in the stunt show in the studio, the cast members seemed to sometimes forget that they weren   t catering to a completely French audience, forgetting at times to translate, and blabbering away in French while the English were left to guess what they were saying. There was also one point when Lightning McQueen turned up, Mater was on the big screen talking in French while Lightning spoke English, what was the point of that? When we went to the    Armageddon    attraction, the cast member decided that because there were more French people than any other race in our group she would talk solely French and we were left to read the screens to find out what was going on, the attraction turned out to be THE biggest waste of time, avoid it at all costs, it really is time best spent elsewhere, probably the queue for another ride. DLRP needs to decided which language it wants to use and stick to it.The good points were the parades which our daughter really enjoyed and the    Disney dreams    show at park closing time which was utterly magical, but you need to get there well on time to appreciate, again however, it was a mix of French and English talking which seemed a bit pointless. The people who say this resort is a magical, wonderful place are either obviously really easily pleased and as I have said, have the mentality of a six year old, or have too much bloody money and don   t care about its failings. Disney should have walked away from this place when it had the chance. This review will be followed up by an email to DLRP, which if their cast member   s attitudes are anything to go by, will be promptly deleted. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"

            "Translation error: justt returned from disneyland paris on friday 5th april after five days in the disney hotel cheyenne,,,,first of all this was my second trip to disneyland paris with my disabled son and partner and i can tell you what a failure disneyland is to disabled people,on the first day we went to city hall to receive a disabled badge for easy access onto rides firstly the guy in city hall didnt understand us and gave us the wrong card which meant we couldnt get on many rides,i then went back the next day to get this card replaced to be told by another guy working in city hall that he couldnt give me another card as i already had one he was geting very nasty to me and actually said he didnt understand what i was saying which i found astonishing as he shouldnt be working there if he didnt understand,,,i come from belfast with a british accent not timbuktu..when i finally got this card replaced we set of to enjoy the rides but after showing this green card we where left standing whilst the ordinary queue was moving quicker than the disabled queue and this was when boats and rides passed with empty seats,also at the designated area for disabled people to watch the parade they had a rule that only one of the childs parent was allowed to enter this area with there disabled child which i found quite odd as his mum had to stand outside the disabled area which then made my son scared..also i had a argument with 3 of the staff at the train bus ride in disney village that takes you through the set of london and a mountain feature with a rush of water and fire,,,we entered the disabled area and showed are green badge for the ride and the girl at the disabled area said we would have to wait 30 mins to go on this ride and she marked us down in her folder which we didnt mind but she said we couldnt leave the area so we stood and waited then a crowd of people entered this area,this girl i was originallly talking to left and went on the tour and left somebody else in charge,we where told we where the next tour when it arrived but when it did arrive we never got on it and this was after waiting 45 mins already,i then called her and said we where meant to get on that tour and you let other people go in front of us and my child is starting to get distressed she then said sorry you are on the next one thats when i got angry and said are card number is in the folder that you have are you not reading it she then didnt no what to say and there was about 4 of them that huddled together and started talking french to each other as they obviously didnt no what they where doing which i then told them its a disgrace use dont no what is going on use need to start reading the folder and taking account for what use are doing,we then got on the ride after waiting 1 hour which was originally meant to be 30 mins as for the price of food in the park and hotels its a total disgrace mainly all burgers and chips and no decent food to be got anywhere,,for instance we got 3 burgers 3 chips and 3 cokes and it was 35 euro at todays going rate that is about 35 pounds sterling these are the prices all over disneyland and i dont think you would get any cheaper as some other areas are dearer and to be honest these are not great burgers and chips kfc is a lot better and thats honestly,,as for items for sale in the shops take your disneyshop in your high street in the uk and every item is double the price in the parks and hotels in disneyland.we also seen 2 rats in the park one was massive and the other was on its way there also..all in all french ignorant,expensive,wont be back,,staff training poor..rides breaking down whilst on them which was peter pan ride. french IGNORANT staff training is a must for disney staff...airport staff at charles de gaulle airport where also a total disgrace to my disabled son they didnt think he was disabled and he was in a wheelchair they made me lift him out for security and i already had details put on my holiday arrangements that he was which when i was explaining this at security and after showing them a disabled badge they didnt no what i meant,,passengers behind us at security actually came over to us at departure lounge and couldnt believe what happened and they even said that it was a disgrace at what they made us do,,,i believe that if you want to visit disneyland save your money for florida as eurodisney is not worth the money...ALSO keep your valuables with you at all times,we left my childs wheelchair pram outside the peter pan ride with my sons mickey mouse blanket draped over the back of the handles securely,when we got of the ride the blanket had been stolen which we couldnt believe what sick minded people are out there that they would steal a blanket of a disabled pram not to mention who would give there child another childs blanket is beyond belief,obviously who ever done this had watched us leaving the pram outside peter pan ride and entering the ride to then steal the blanket,to be honest we where glad as we could have easily left valuables attached to the pram,i asked the disney staff did they see anyone at the pram and yet again she didnt no what i was saying...TYPICAL..i hope this helps a lot of people make up there mind before they visit or think about visiting. thanks --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"

            "Translation error: Before travelling I trawled through this forum to get as many tips as possible, so now that I am back I'll give some sort of report along with the tips I took, and my own. We were brought here by my inlaws as a trip to celebrate their 50th Wedding anniversary. Because they booked it all we didn't have any control over anything so it was a bit of a stressful trip. We have two small children, 22 months and 3, it was freezing cold (obviously out of the control of Disney!) and as such the kids didn't enjoy it at all (not surprised!).We stayed at the newport bay club and walked in on both days. The first day we went straight to the peter pan ride and both kids screamed in the queue the entire time (25 min wait). We had to leave the park to warm the boys up and sat in mcdonalds for an hour, as there didn't seem to be anything open where we could sit inside and have a coffee cake etc. After that we came in to the park again but the boys were asleep in the pushchair so just wondered around. Went to the Studios and wondered for a bit, both kids still asleep. They woke up in time for the stunt show spectacular   featuring Lightening Mcqueen (only on for about 5 mins of the 45mins total) It was outside and freezing so the kids got too cold again, except we were stuck there until it finished. My husband loved this as it was car chases etc. Eldest boy mildly amused. Went back to hotel as the kids just weren't enjoying it, and got ready for our meal at L'Auberge. This was also a bit stressful and they didn't eat anything and were scared of the characters. After they warmed up a bit they posed for one photo. That day was a write off and I was very glad I wasn't paying for it myself, thinking it was a monumental waste of money!Day two was much much better. Sun was out and therefore warmed us up by 1 degree, seemed to make all the difference!Went back to peter pan and waited for 25 mins again (during EMH) as my eldest wanted to go on it again. Then tea cups, then casey juniors train ride, then story book land. Then Lunch at Cafe Mickey (recommended!), then they both fell asleep again. End of fun!Went to toy story land 3 times as they are both buzz mad, but on all occasions they were either asleep or too cold to want to get out of the pushchair. Tried to get to the parade but didn't get there in time and didn't see anything. Kids still not interested in getting out of the pushchair.In all, I'd say they were just too young to appreciate and enjoy it. Disneyland itself is amazing, magical and I love it. It's expensive, yes, but what do you expect? My point is, wait until you can have a better chance of enjoying it, instead of constantly getting  I don't want to  or  I want to go home  from your small kid. We didn't really have any issues with queues as we didn't go on any big rides, didn't come across any smokers and didn't get pushed. But then I don't think we were in the park as much as you would be normally.My tips:*Take an extra blanket, you may not need it but if you do it's soooooo worth it. The kids had a much better day on the second day when I brought the blankets out with us. * Take snacks to keep them going. And maybe a flask with hot drinks, as difficult to get somewhere to sit and shelter. They check your bag on the way in but nobody batted an eyelid at the amount of food and drink in my change bag. Plus they didn't check the pushchair if you need to stash more substantial food there!*Take a kettle for the room if you need to make milk for the babies. Or tea for yourself to warm up!*Book character lunch at Cafe Mickey, expensive but so worth it! We also had dinner at L'Auberge and met the princesses. This meant we didn't feel the need to queue at any other time to meet and take photos with the characters. the queues for these were horrendous in the day!*Do the buzz lightyear laser blast if you have a small boy and toy story fan. Morning is best, queue was 25 mins at around 11am. *Comfortable shoes*Thermal underwear for kids! Tie the gloves to strings to their jackets so they don't get lost. Hats and scarves a must. All in one for the littlies even better!*Get a map so you can pinpoint toilets, various stops both for children and inlaws! One in the arcade just parallel to main street is ace because it is indoors and you can warm up while waiting for the toilet goers. Warning, only one set of toilets in the village and you will not be allowed to go in any of the shops restaurants cinema unless you are already a customer of that establishment (fair enough otherwise they would have a lot of maintenance)*Use the EMH to get to the kiddie rides. Fast passes if you can, but the peter pan one wasn't working. *It's a small world annoying as usual, but the kids enjoyed it. Or eldest should I say, the youngest was asleep!*Don't go on the eurostar, too long a trip and too much hassle with luggage and pushchair, although bonus is station right by village. Also, the only train out of there is at 6pm and after checking out at 11am you are stranded for 6 7 hours if you don't have a park ticket for that day.*If you are going eurostar, try and do the Disney express that take your luggage to the hotel, and back to the station, especially if you are stranded for hours on end.*If you are going to see the parade you have to be there at least 4.30 for the 5pm start, otherwise you will see nothing. Even if you stand back because everyone has people on their shoulders. *See the disney dreams show, it is spectacular. BUT COLD! Wrap up for that. Hot drink flask a must for this occasion. Small kids may be scared, eldest ok, but 22 month old just whimpered and cried the whole time (and he is a bruiser normally).I can't remember anything else, but will write in the comments section if I remember! --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"

            "Translation error: Hi,I am not really one for writing lots of reviews about places, but I lurve reading reviews and I found many of the reviews on trip advisor really useful when we planned our trip.We booked with TUI just before xmas 2012. My husband and I had decided we were going to take the plunge and take our little boy of 2 years 5 months to see Mickey and friends. We told my cousin and her hubby and she asked if they could join us! The more the merrier.My hubby is a real planner which is just what you need for Disneyland. If i were to advise anyone on anything it to plan especially if you have young children.We also had a watch word; you snooze, you lose!!!!!!!!!!We stayed at the Newport Bay hotel on floor 7, the Admirals floor. Our trip to paris was excellent flying from Birmingham international.I would say that the French seem inempt at keeping baggage together. My Cousin and her hubby lost two bags! Yes, 2 bags and the airport staff whilst helpful, seemed unconcerned as we got the impression it was a common occurance!!!!!We booked out transfer with TUI and were taken by coach to our hotel. Check in was great as the Admirals floor has its own check in. This is one of the reasons why we chose it as queuing was going to be a common feature of the trip and the more we could avoid the better!The room was large and spacious. George, our son, is only 2 and went free and consequently we didn't get a cot although you can book them. My cousin was luckier and had an adjoining room with 2 large beds so her children could sleep together. George slept in our bed and all was well. The room was clean. I am a real stickler for cleanliness and it was acceptable. The grouting in the room needed scrubbing with bleach and a toothbrush and the bathroom light needed a major dust, but other than that it was just fine.The snooze and lose watch word was to do with breakfast. We booked 7am breakfeast. Forget the word holiday when coming to Disneyland. Be prepared to rise early, be out on your feet for 14 hours and crash into your bed. 7am was a great time to get brekkie as it was not busy. by 7.30am and 8am people were queueing for tables...as i said, i hate queues with toddlers, so we avoided this. Continetal brekkie was served with a good choice of stuff. We filled our juice bottles from the machines and the waiters didn't seem to mind. I ddin't do the whole sandwich making thing as we ate in the park.We had a half board plus option with our booking. This meant we got brekkie and a meal. This is where prior booking is essential! We saw the Buffalo Bills Wild West Show (79 euros per adult for front seats) on the first night which is excellent. Great food, great atmosphere and entertaining for all ages. You chow down on a campfire feast of chilli,corn bread, chicken, ribs and apple pie with unlimited drinks at the table. We paid for front seats and the toddlers were free. This meant we had them our lap and technically they didn't get food, but the waiters just gave us extra food for them without any question.It is essential to book all entertainment like this in advance. Phone the park and book ALL restraunts you intend to use. My huuby trawled trip advisor for the best eating houses which we could use on half board plus and booked up in January!Day two saw us hit the park. Again we planned which area we would hit so we could do as much as possbile. We left the hotel at 8am and walked to the park. There is a train but we opted to walk to limber up for the day ahead. Baggage check into the park is cursory for weapons i guess. They don't care you have drinks and snacks and I packed masses of them in the case and took stuff daily. Cereal bars, Fruit pouches, tetra pak juice, choccy, etc are essentials or you'll be spending lots more than necessary. We ate at the Blue Lagoon restraunt. Lovely and exotic food. They had a kids menu for the 6 year old (who is fussy and hates chips!) and had a choices she liked. The men ate Barracuda and my cousin and I had chicken. Starter, Dessert and a drink were included at half board plus. The choice was from a 34 euro per head menu, so not bargain basement rubbish. Luckily the toddlers slept for most of the meal but when awake the waiters gave us FREE food for them which was a bonus!That evening we ate at McDonlads as we had a late lunch. Not snazzy, but not pricey either.We saw the evening spectacular and my little boy was awe struck. I have to say it is totally worth staying around for.Wednesday saw us hit the Studios part opf the park. We'd booked a meal at the all you can eat called Restraunt Des Stars in the Studios area. Fabulous food. Amazing choice and again the toddlers ate free. This was part of our half board plus package.The evening was our night to go to Cafe Mickey. OMG! how excited were our kids!!!!!! Again, book or you'll be eating at 9pm. We saw all of the main characters and they spent time at our tables, signed the autograph books and the kids thought it was magic. This is a great option rather than buying breakfast at Cafe Mickey for 20 euros per child plus and adult fee too! The food was lovely, the service was slow and hit n miss but you go for the experience and the magic, not the service!Thursday we hit another area of the park and went to walts for late lunch. Again we'd boked because believe me you won't get a booking walking in off the street and my cousin and I were convinced they vetted those walking in on spec!!!!!!!!!!! An amazing setting, a great menu with a good childs choice. Not really the type of place to take toddlers I would say but we have the opinion our money is a good as anyones.....! This place is a little up market. The staff less used to dealing with kids. We had to pay for a meal here for the toddlers. They shared a 10 euro bowl of pasta. We saw both the Parade and the evening spectacular. They are a must.Friday, our last day. We checked our luggage into storage and hit the park again. This was do rides the kids had not done within reason. We went to Planet Hollywood for a goodbye lunch. You cannot book here.......... 133 Euros for 4 adults and 3 kids. Pricey, but worth it!We had a magical holiday. Yes, we spent quite a bit ...around 2500 pounds. My little boy spent 100 euros (given by grandparents etc.) in the shops but he got lots of stuff and hey, he went to have a good time and thats what he's had!!!!!!!DO's and DON'TsDO....PLAN PLAN PLANBOOK ALL RESTRAUNTS IN ADVANCETAKE SNACKS AND DRINKS IN YOUR CASETAKE TEA, COFFEE HOT CHOCCY FOR YOUR ROOM AS ITS GRATIS JUST ONCE!LABEL LUGGAGE REALLY WELL AND SPREAD STUFF ABOUT IN CASES SO IF ONE IS LOST YOU'LL STILL HAVE CLOTHES UNTIL THEY TURN UPGO WITH VIEW YOU'LL BE OUT 12 HOURS PER DAY plusTAKE GOOD WALKING SHOESTAKE A HAT, GLOVES, SCARF AND LAYERS OF COATS AS ITS VERY COLDTAKE A PUCHCHAIR EVEN IF YOU CHILD IS WALKING ..........ITS A GOOD TROLLEYTAKE A BLANKET OR TWO FOR EVENING SHOWSTAKE LONG JOHN'S AND THERMALSGO WITH A VIEW IT'S DISNEY....IT'S GOING BE MAGICALGO WITH A VIEW, IT'S DISNEY, THINGS WON'T BE CHEAPBE AN EARLY BIRD FOR BREKKIE   YOU SNOOZE, YOU LOSESTOCK UP ON DISNEY CLOTHING FROM ASDA ETC TO SAVE YOU SOME CASH OUT THERESTOCK UP ON FLASHES, GLOW STICKS ETC FOR THE EVENING SHOW FROM POUNLAND AND THE LIKE (THEY SELL DISNEY STUFF VERY CHEAPLY)GO TO THE PARADEGO TO THE NIGHT SHOWHAVE COFFEE STOPS TO KEEP YOUR LEVELS UPTAKE A CAMERAUSE FASTPASS TO QUEUE BUSTUSE THE IPHONE APP TO TELL YOU WHERE QUEUES ARE SMALLESTDON'TGO IF YOU HATE WALKINGGO WITH THE IMPRESSION IT'S GOING TO BE CHEAP OR YOU'LL SPEND ALL YOUR TIME BEING MISERABLEI honestly was really sceptical about this trip. I hate theme parks but even I got into it. I didn't go on the fast thrill rides but those i went on were lovely. What was important we had a lovely family time. I took a pushchair lock as i'd rad to do so, but honestly, i didn't use it. People are in the same boat as you there with kids and nothing went missing from the trolley or the snack bag i left when we were on rides.It is scrupuliously clean as there are always people out litter picking and sweeping. The toilets were clean and fresh (i did go at peak time though). The staff are helpful and very friendly. They want you to have a fab time! --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"

            "Translation error: Disney guide,Getting there, eating, trains,rides, queue and fastpass. Please click more to read all the article.I had a two day pass, which I purchased on line. It's available on the day but the on line voucher was 93 pound where as buying from Disney on the day it cost 131 euros. if you're can get a voucher pre hand you'll save money.With the voucher all you have to do is take it to the counters that are selling tickets to redeem for your Disney ticket, job done.Getting thereWe stayed at val de Europe which was one stop away on the RER train line, it took about 3 mins by this train. If you do stay in the Val de Europe area, don't use the local bus as this will take you around the whole Val de Europe village taking around 30 minutes.TIP,,,, if you buy train tickets, we asked about return tickets like you buy in England, they didn't offer this system, you just buy two tickets, one for the outward bound journey, one for the return.Important when you start you train journey don't enter the platform through an open gate, you ticket will not work when you try to leave the platform the other end of your journey, by running your ticket through the machine when you enter the platform you validate your ticket, the machines at the other end recognise a validated ticket, it won't recognise your ticket and you'll have problems getting out..EatingLots to choose from on the park, But there is a avenue of restaurants including Planet Hollywood, Starbucks, McDonalds and many more, if you want something a little more adventurous such as Italian, Chinese, you can come off the site get on a train to val de Europe it will take you 5mins by train and choose from a number of restaurant's and there's a lovely shopping centre there, including a huge French supermarket Auchan that sells everything from lobster to paracetamol . Hot slices of pizza, panini's, huge fruit and veg area, fresh bread you can get almost everything from this supermarket. What you can't get from there you'll get from the rest of the shops. Designer clothes, games, hardware even a dry cleanersThere's also a Sea world.Disneyworld the parkWell on arriving you have to redeem your voucher this can be done at any of the ticket kiosk.Once through the gates you are met by the Main Street area this includes plenty of Disney shops and restaurants.The Disney trainIt's goes around the perimeter of the the park giving in you an over view on the park.TIP,,, get on at the main entrance, there are four other entrances but we found that at the other stops nobody was getting of as they got on at the main entrance and travelled all the way round.The way it works is, people off people on, so If nobody gets off nobody can get on and if all got on at the main entrance they tend to get off there.Fast pass and queuingThere's signs above the entry point of each ride telling how long you will wait from certain points,these are very accurate.There's a free service called fast pass, which is great. This is how it works, near each ride there will be a collection of four five machines which normally have attends close by. If you can't find he machines ask the Disney attendants at the main entrance to the ride you want to get on.You run your main Disney ticket through a fast pass machine it will give you another ticket with a time on it, these are normally 30min, say from 12:35 13:10 and that is the time you can enter the ride. The time slot is normally displayed above the fast pass machines. Don't worry If you don't make it back. You can get another fast pass ticket after the time slot on you original fast pass ticket has passed. This system only run up until certain time always check when the fast pass system stops.This will save you load of time queuing. I queued for 40mins on the Temple of Doom through normally queue system.The next day I got a fast pass ticket for mountain roller coaster, I got the ticket at 10:39, my slot was 12:30 13:10 so away I went for another ride came back there was a 40min wait in the normal queue, I went throughout the fast past queue, 8mins later I was on the ride, whoopieeeee.The showsIn the leaflets you get when you by your tickets, you'll find times for when all the shows are on.We caught the big parade which came around at 17:00 this was great and had all the main characters from Disney on it.There are also bands playing at certain times on the stages scattered around the parks this happens at certain time, check the time tables. The Disneyland characters make appearance around the park again check the time tables this will tell you when and where they will be..The night showIf Disney could be more magical.The night certainly hit all the right buttons, Disneyland Paris is twice as magical.Castles and building were all illuminated, bands playing it was great, there is a celebration at 10:00 or 9:00 check times, I think 9:00 is Sunday.It's not just fireworks......There's a animations Display projected onto the castle based on Peter Pan, Including many Disney characters, there's lasers, fire blast and fireworks.The crowds are not for the faint hearted though, everybody's wants their bit of Disney magic. Putting this aside it was spectacular, get a good place though, I got there around 20:30 and loads of people where already there in prime position.We stayed at the Relais SPA Val D'Europe the hotel was booked through Easy click, it cost 210 for three nights, the hotel it self was well fitted, nice and clean, positioned on the outside of the village. 2 5 walking distance from the restaurant and shopping centre.The room was superb, very clean and plenty of room.Went through the main door into the room and found a galley style kitchen microwave, fridge and dishwasher. There were two doors, one into the bedroom the other into the bathroom.The bedroom was spacious the bed was very comfy, nice fixtures and fitting. Nice size bedroom and bathroom.Room all round very spacious, clean. Helpfull staff, a taxi cost 100euros.I would diffidently use this hotel again..ps it was a Great... --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"

            "Translation error: We stayed at the Davy Crockett Ranch at Disneyland Paris in August 2012   4 adults and 2 children aged 6 and almost 3. It was interesting to compare as I visited the park when it was still 'Eurodisney' back when it first opened. It seemed as though standards of cleanliness and staffing had gown downhill.Biggest gripe: Smoking is supposed to be prohibited other than in designated areas. But no one seems to check and people were smoking all over the place   including in the queues, in restriced space. It was unpleasant in such a supposedly family friendly environment. (Another potentially big gripe   what is the point of the bag checks? The security staff were giving the bags a cursory check   anything could have been smuggled in under buggies as these weren't checked.)More minor gripes:Ok, so if you go to Disneyland in the middle of August, you expect to queue. But the queues were incredibly restrictive with young children (90 minutes and more for the most popular rides). As we were staying at a Disneyland resort we thought we would be able to benefit from the early opening time for guests. But although the park itself opens for guests at 8am, very few rides open until gone 9 o clock and most open at 10, when the crowds start to come in. We did manage to get on some of the rides in Fantasyland early on, but so much more could be done to accommodate guests in the two hour period between 8 and 10. Information as to which rides open early on which days could be made much clearer. Rides could open earlier. Many of the drinks stands also remain closed for a long time   once we were inside Fantasyland early in the morning, there was nowhere to buy a coffee. When they did open, rides were not being used to their capacity   on the It's a Small World ride at around 10.15 one morning, two boats were going around empty for every one that was filled   even though there was still a queue of people whose wait could have been minimised. On the Pinocchio ride, seats were left empty (three people were being sent around in carts which can accommodate at least 6) despite there being a 20 minute queue. It's particularly disappointing that the Studio Park doesn't open early. We managed to get around most of the suitable rides in the Disneyland Park (in Fantasyland at least) over the 4 day stay, though taking advantage of the (limited) early opening. As we were unable to do the same in the Studio Park, we chose not to join the 30 min minimum queues in the middle of the day for any of the rides in the Toy Story area. It's also made to look as though the Toy Story area contains a playground. It doesn't. Our children enjoyed the play areas in the main Disneyland park (eg in AdventureLand and the Pochohontas playground in Frontierland). It would be good though if such areas could be increased enlarged to accommodate people whose children are too young to stand in queues of an hour and more. Crowds leaving the parade area around 7.30 are dangerous and badly directed by staff. Based on earlier experience we knew that food prices are prohibitive (which was one of the reasons we chose the Davy Crockett ranch so we could self cater). It remains the case that food is over priced and of poor quality. Avoid if you can.PositivesDespite the gripes our two children still had lots of fun and they loved the parade at 7pm. It's disappointing again though that there aren't more parades. The best thing about the break was the accommodation. We'd definitely recommend the Davy Crockett ranch. One junction down the A4 towards Paris, it was so good to get away from the parks in the peak of the day (we got into the parks early, had 3 4 hours there and came back for lunch before heading back for the parade at 7). The 'bungalows' at the ranch were basic but clean, with adequate faciliites for cooking (no ovens but we knew this in advance and planned meals accordingly). The ranch site itself was great with plenty for us to do   big pool, mini golf, archery, pony rides   there was also a Robin Hood evening on our last evening with dancing and archery   the children loved this. Staff at the ranch were extremely friendly and helpful   much more so than the staff working in the parks themselves. Advice   if you're staying at one of the Disneyland resorts get in early and make the most of what early opening there is   though check what rides are open (there's an Information board in the area in front of the castle) and be aware that most rides will remain closed until 10. Self cater if possible! You can bring picnics but can't eat them in the park itself; there's a picnic area just outside. It's worth knowing that sandwiches and coffee at the train station (right outside the entrance to the parks) are much better value and quality than anything in Disneyland itself. Be prepared for long walks   the path from the car parks to the parks themselves is very long (though there are travelators).Make the most of areas that don't necessarily involve queues   there's lots to explore in Adventure Land   caves bridges the cabin of Swiss Family Robinson   which can be done after you've been on some of the rides. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"

            "Translation error: J'ai été deux fois dans les parcs de Disneys à Orlando, en Floride, en 1991 et 1995. Cette fois, j'ai profité de l'occasion, visitant Paris, pour emmener mes enfants pour avoir l'expérience d'Eurodisney, comme ils le voulaient tellement. J'ai été averti des amis des grandes files d'attente. Mais je ne pouvais pas imaginer que pour chaque attraction principale (sauf le petit monde), la file d'attente devait être de 60 minutes !!! Mais le prenons depuis le début. Nous y sommes arrivés à midi. Pour entrer à l'intérieur, vous devez passer le parking. Le parking coûte 15 euros, quelque chose d'assez cher pour juste un parking en plein air. De là, vous devez marcher beaucoup pour entrer dans le parc et il y a des couloirs en mouvement, mais certains ne fonctionnent pas. Ensuite, et même si vous ne êtes pas entré dans le parc, il y a un message de bienvenue en anglais et en français, qui est la même toute la journée (même à minuit ...) et vous l'écoutez plusieurs fois, devenant ennuyeux. Après une assez longue marche (au moins 10 minutes), vous atteignez l'entrée du parc. J'ai payé 57 euros pour les adultes (plus de 11 ans, également pour ma fille de 13 ans!), Prépayé dans mon hôtel (le prix normal de 1 parc était de 61 euros). Entrer à l'intérieur d'avoir un billet est facile. La première chose que je pensais pénétrer à l'intérieur est de ce que cette chose américaine a à voir avec l'Europe. La rue principale que vous trouverez devant vous est une réplique d'une vieille ville aux États-Unis. C'est donc quelque chose de la culture européenne. Ok, tu me diras que c'est de l'argent, la façon de penser américaine! Et c'est sûrement !!! Il y a beaucoup de gens qui se déplacent, avec beaucoup d'enfants (cet endroit est pour eux). Se déplacer ne m'a pas impressionné, sauf de la façon dont ils ont changé l'endroit en faisant le lac avec le bateau fluvial et les changements dans une petite jungle. La compagnie Disney a très bien protégé l'environnement, car il y a une forêt là-bas, quelque chose que vous pouvez voir si vous prenez le train en faisant le tour du parc (mais nous l'avons attendu 40 minutes, au lieu de 30 que le panneau a écrit ...). Nous avons eu l'occasion de voir des lapins dans leur environnement réel. Comme je l'ai dit, toutes les principales attractions (Pirates of the Carribean, Toys Lazer Show, Peter Pan et autres) ont eu une file d'attente de 60 minutes. Nous n'avons donc vu aucun d'entre eux, car personne de nous ne pouvait être en ligne pendant aussi longtemps; C'est juste idiot. Le petit monde est agréable, mais normalement est juste pour les enfants. Il y avait 2 défilés, un à 19 h. et un le soir, à 22h30 Ils étaient gentils et fantaisistes (surtout la nuit avec les lumières). Ils pourraient sûrement trouver un meilleur thème de musique pour le défilé de l'après-midi. Alors que le parc a célébré cette année son 20e anniversaire, ils ont eu un spectacle spécial la nuit au château de la Belle au bois dormant avec des effets vidéo, des incendies, des vapeur, des eaux, des lazer et des feux d'artifice. Cela a commencé à 23h00. et a une durée de 20 minutes. C'est agréable et spectaculaire, mais ça commence très tard et la plupart des gens et surtout les enfants sont très fatigués en ce moment. À Orlando, ces émissions (parce que l'obscurité commence là plus tôt) commence à 21h00. Et c'est un meilleur moment. Et une autre mauvaise chose était que je devais lever la plupart du temps ma fille de 10 ans pour le voir, car elle ne pouvait pas bien voir avec autant de gens debout, car le spectacle n'était pas seulement des feux d'artifice dans le ciel, mais qui se sont également déroulés dans les parties basses du château, et c'est un moins, qui n'a pas été pensé des personnes qui l'ont conçu. Donc, après le spectacle, cette foule de personnes fatiguées (remarquez que beaucoup d'enfants sont normalement éveillés à ce moment-là et que les parents devaient donc les endormir) doivent faire une grande marche vers les voitures ou vers le train pour rentrer chez eux. Cela montre qu'ils pensaient que de l'argent en mettant le parc dans la région de Paris et pas aux gens ... et tout cela pour entrer dans un parc Luna ... la nourriture était chère et le plus de souvenirs est trop cher. Je ne pouvais pas croire à mes yeux, qu'il n'y a pas de restaurant en dehors de Disneyland, car il y en a beaucoup à Orlando. Donc, le seul choix que vous avez, si vous n'avez pas apporté des sandwichs, c'est de y manger. Vous ne pouvez pas bien sûr vous attendre à ce que la nourriture soit quelque chose de spécial, car ils doivent servir de grandes foules. La restauration rapide est donc ce que vous vous attendez à trouver. Les toilettes où je suis allé étaient suffisamment propres pour une telle foule. Il n'y a que 2 3 points, où vous pouvez boire de l'eau sans eau. En raison de la fatigue, la moitié des habitants de notre entreprise (nous avions 8 ans) ne pouvait pas voir les spectacles de nuit. Nous avons donc dû retourner à notre hôtel, puis revenir pour cela. C'était deux fois les itinéraires avec les couloirs et tout cela. Une bonne façon de perdre du poids, mais ne convient pas à beaucoup de gens et d'enfants. Donc, en conclusion, vous donnez beaucoup d'argent pour être si fatigué et c'est très ennuyeux pour moi. Ils ont dû suivre une autre politique financière pour un parc Luna. Le tout peut vous coûter pour une famille de 4 personnes, ainsi que de la nourriture et des souvenirs, plus de 300 euros, qui sont beaucoup d'argent, et ils ne le méritent pas. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"

            "Translation error: If this review saves anyone the overwhelming sense of disappointment, frustration and anger that we have recently endured during our trip (6 to 8 July), then at least something positive may be said of our recent visit to Disneyland Paris. Our party comprised 2 adults and 2 children (6 and 3), and lasted 2 nights, 3 days. It started positively enough with good value for money parking at the local NCP car park and easy access to the train station. Passport control was efficient and embarkation stress free. We then arrived at DLP. Our bags were left at the station and were available for collection at the hotel, so far, so good. Upon arrival at the Station, we were herded into the main shopping and restaurant area. We wandered up and down the main street looking for signs for the main parks,or someone to ask. The one employee we did find, claimed not to know where the main park was...helpful. To be fair, it wasn't that difficult to find, and entry into the main attractions was hassle free (but only with Pre booked tickets, which fortunately we had). Once inside, the enormity of our mistake in coming here began to sink   it was packed,and I mean really,really packed. Many people may be afraid to tell themselves, and their friends, that they did not enjoy their visit because of its cost, and because of the build up to something which for many may be a once in a lifetime experience. But, I can tell you, our immediate observation was that the park was filled with stressed and angry looking parents, and children in melt down: and the ratio of positive to negative comments on this and other sites is not reflective of the sense which we got of the experience people were having. So, we wandered up the main street of the main park, and there were more shops selling the same merchandise available in the shops in the area into which we disembarked   always good to have a second chance in life. Then, some restaurants, then, some more shops. At last we arrived at the entrance of the big castle, and to be fair, it was pretty impressive (especially if you are 3 and 6). A good photo opportunity taken. We moved into the area of the main attractions. I'll spare you a blow by blow account of each ride but suffice it to say, the ride to queue ratio was about 30 minutes queue to 1 minute ride. Most rides lasted for about two minutes, and we did not not queue for anything for less than 55 minutes. Do not trust the queue ready reckoners   they bear no resemblance to reality, and it was not often that this was a point in one's favour. At the merest hint of humidity, most of the rides shut down creating tremendous pressure on those which remained open, and the few play areas were particularly sensitive to the weather. I appreciate the good h&s reasons why this was necessary. The queues, and their length, were a particular problem for those attractions such as meeting the princesses where by the time one actually got to meet the princess (two on shift at any one time, and you're told who you'll see) the children were in a state of total boredom, frequently in tears, and not prepared to talk to anyone   and to be clear, this was not just (one of) my children but around 75% of the queue population   some of these will have been your friends who will have told some of you what a fantastic experience the whole thing was. The child in front of us refused to meet the princess because he was so bored, and one of ours was totally dis interested by the time the big moment came. To be fair to the character, she was very good, and one of my children loved the fleeting moment. But: in, hello, photo, out. Only time will tell if the 75 minutes queue was worth the wait , I hope my daughter remembers the event with fondness. With the exception of a fleeting, long distance glimpse of the disney princesses during one of the parades (which were fun, it has to be said) that was the sum total of access to those characters   access to them was very, very tightly protected. Indeed,the following day, we saw them make a sprint from the location of the meet and greet, to wherever was their destination   not quite ignoring the crowds but clearly uncomfortable about being seen in the open. Once or twice a day, one of the cartoon characters would make an appearance for 5 or 10 minutes, and so starved was the population of access to their favourite characters whom they had travelled to see and meet, that they were very quickly swamped by the crowd,including by adults with no thought for others. It is hard to explain,and the anger is subsiding as the memory fades, but the way the queues were engineered in itself gave rise to stress and tension. Somehow, the designers had managed to insinuate that the end of the queue was nigh, and just as we thought we were near the queue's end, we would perhaps take a corner which revealed several hundreds of previously unseen queuers, or into another room where the real queuing was about to begin. You will know what I mean if, when balancing the positive and negative reviews, you decide that only by itching yourself the Disney scratch will you be able sleep easily again at night! Toilets. Some reviewers have said that the toilets were disgusting. We did not find this to be the case but what I would say is that they were not in abundance, and neither were they very well signposted (nor was anything, for that matter). For many, this will not be a problem but for those with children between, say, 2 and 4,there is sometimes an urgency associated with these matters which is best served with immediate, or near immediate, access to such a facility! Food. The following sentence is one which I thought I would never write, nor even give consideration to writing. By far and away ......(forgive me, my fingers are struggling to input the necessary letters) Macdonalds was the best value for money (with a caveat) but more importantly by the point at which we took the decision (after a family crisis conference) wholesome and tasty meal we ate. For supper on the first day, we visited a pizza pasta place where we queued to order and pay and then queued to collect the food. I'm not sure how the chef managed to create this thing which was called a pizza but it seemed, somehow, watered down   it was devoid of taste, of constituency, of heat, of any sense of enjoyment or even simply physical fulfilment (and I know that may sound particularly ungrateful and immaterial in comparison to the plight of some, as may the rest of this review, but I would ask that it be read in context). I don't believe that water actually escaped from it when it was punctured with my knife and fork, though it may have been, but I would not have been surprised had it been. I've always thought it to be pretty impossible to get pizzas or beef burgers that wrong and so the next day (and I do feel guily about this) we had lunch at a burger bar. Again, we queued for about 30 minutes (at peak time,to be fair) and having been served then discovered that the ability of the restaurant to serve customers far exceeded its ability to seat them. We sat and ate our tepid filler on the floor outside the outlet. The food in the 'meet the Disney characters' place was the probably the worst and must have derived from the universal beast   fish indistinguishable from chicken, chicken from beef. Indistinguishable that is except in the hostility with which it was served, and the (cold) temperature at which it was served. All that said, the   30 odd per head did provide the best 30 minutes the children had across the 3 days with a good selection of cartoon characters enthusiastically visiting each table and so in that respect did provide some sort of value. Shows. The shows were good, and if I had my time again with the experience of the past 3 days, I would make more use of these opportunities. Though the queues were often excruciating one at least got 10 15 minutes of 'payback' (most shows advertised duration of 20 minutes) but at least 5 minutes of that time was spent telling the audience not to take pictures, film or do anything which may in any way infringe copyright (didn't seem so worried about telling it where fire doors etc were located). What, you may ask, did I expect? Well, I didn't expect my wife to cry in pure frustration at the overwhelmingly disappointing experience (she is a wonderfully pragmatic person and always seeks out the sitive in any given situation person) and I didn't expect the 3 year old constantly to ask to go home. I recognise that I am lucky to have been able to have experienced this, and some may say 'I would love the opportunity to queue for 90 minutes with my chidlren'. If you are lucky enough to be able to save hard to afford a holiday this year, then my strongest advice would be not to go to DLP. Long and rambling, for which apologies, but I hope this helps. The sequoia hotel was fine, by the way. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"

            "Translation error: My boyfriend and I spent four days in Disneyland Paris starting on the 4th June 2012. Firlstly my advice is to wear comfortable walking shoes because although I was wearing trainers, my feet ached like hell after a few hours of walking around. The disneyland parks are very clean, everywhere you look a member of staff is cleaning the area. There are lots of rides for kids and adults but the queuing system for the adult rides is more than questionable. Many people jumping ques entering into the parks or for rides, at one point after queuing for nearly half an hour for Space Mountain, we noticed that another 2 ques were filtering into our que which caused bottle necking and confusion and more que jumping by others.....staff don't seem that bothered even when people are pushing past quite violently just to get to the front! One of the rides we went on was Phantom Manor. This was a bit disapointing for us as the whole dialogue was in French with no translations so you had no idea of the story behind what you was looking at and why!?! Either brush up on your French or just go with the flow, and this was also the same for the Pinocchio ride as well. It also rained on most of the days while we were at the park and of course Disneyland Paris did not think twice about charging people 10    for poncho's you wouldnt even pay   5 for which leads me on to the next subject,Everything in Disneyland Paris is EXPENSIVE!!! Typical evening meal for an adult is about 25    per person, your looking at about 16    for a child and this seemed to be the same price range no matter what restaurant menu we looked at. Burger, fries and a drink will set you back about 10    and its not exactly fast food as we waited in the que for over 30min for a cold chicken burger and the staff got the order wrong. There is a Disneyland village and I would strongly recommend that if your wanting more options for food other than burger and fries, go there. It has sandwich shops, coffee shops, other snacks and even a McDonalds which is quick and not too far from the price you would pay back in the UKIt appeared to me that no matter what shop you walk into, they all sell the same thing. All the shops sell the Disney hats, dolls and all the usual gift items and again this is when your pockets need to be the deepest........expecially if you have kids. Micky Mouse coffee mug 11   , small Micky Mouse doll about 25   . I did see a child carrying a large Micky Mouse doll and when I was in one of the larger stores, I saw the same exact doll which was 75   ........ouch! T shirts, dolls and toys are a plenty and for the Disneyland experience,                 is key.If you have been lucky enough as a parent to stear your child away from the excitements of the gift shops, there are actually lots of rides to keep your kids occupied and happy but its just the length of time you spend in the ques that a pain so parents please keep taking a deap breath and keep calm when the kids are getting fed up and bored of waiting.Things that are a much see was the Disneyland Parade which was at 7pm, a bit on the late side if you ask me BUT BUT BUT......you much find your spot to sit on the pavement along the parade route about an hour before it starts or you kids may not see the parade due to the crowds and I do mean crowd of people that line the whole route and you can not have your feet on the road at all which is why you need to have enough room on the pavement to sit. Kids and adults will love it but again, its the waiting that gets to you. Once the parade starts, people will push and shove trying to take pictures and to squeeze past you so mannars and politeness will and does go out of the window. Also the fireworks are awsome but again this is at 11pm at night which is really late especially when you have been in the park since the morning, your feet are on fire and your kids are nearly sleep walking because they're so tired BUT if you can make it through the feeling of exhaustion, it is well worth seeing and bear in mind that for this it dosent matter where you sit or stand, you will be able to see everything as long as your can see the castle. The shuttle bus porvided free is nothing but joy to experience. During the morning and afternoon the buses do get quite full and again there is no system for queuing. People will push and shove like its the last bus in the world and when we had to get on the bus after the firework show, the crowd for the buses got quite nasty and I was nearly pushed over by the people at the back of the que, I was actually quite scared and my boyfriend had to pull me out of the way because I was being pushed into the bus door hinges. I have to say that there are a lot of parents with pushchairs who just ram into the backs of your legs.......again mannars and politeness out of the window and this was French, English and all other nationalities behaving in the same way. People did not care who they hurt in the ques and this was the worst thing for me.Top Tips1) Bring packed lunches2) Wear comfy shoes3) Be patient when kids get stressed4) Have plenty of     and budget how much you are wanting to spend each day5) Take a rain coat that can be folded up small, if its raining here in the UK it will most likely rain in Franch too6) Eat in the Disneyland Vilage, far more choice and you will most likely get served quicker7) Make a note of where the toilets are, for some reason they are few and far between and darn hard to find --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"

            "Translation error: Je suis allé à Disneyland Paris vers 7 fois maintenant et je devrais revenir cet été. Mon dernier voyage était en mars 2012, et avant d'écrire plus, je veux juste indiquer quelques choses. Les mauvaises critiques ici sont choquantes, et honnêtement, pas du tout une bonne représentation du parc. Avant d'y aller, il y a quelques choses que vous devriez réaliser, le parc est en France, un pays européen. Est-ce si mal qu'ils devraient parler la moitié de tout en français? Non! Ils parlent en fait tout à moitié français et à moitié anglais. Ils répondent principalement aux Européens, car le parc est en Europe. J'ai fait des manèges, comme les Pirates des Caraïbes par exemple, où toute la balade a été en anglais, d'autres fois en français. Les gens s'attendent à ce que tout soit en anglais, mais vraiment pourquoi devrait-il être. À mon avis, voir les panneaux pour les manèges en français a toujours ajouté à la magie pour moi, et c'est quelque chose qui rend le parc différent des autres. Pas quelque chose dont je me plainais. Le parc n'est pas une copie de quoi que ce soit d'autre. Mon deuxième point est le fait, ce n'est pas la Floride. C'est Disneyland Paris. Un parc complètement différent et unique, avec sa propre magie. Le château à Paris est complètement unique à tout le monde. Les gens doivent cesser de comparer les deux. Allez ici avec un esprit ouvert si vous êtes fanatique de Floride car il est différent. Pas dans le mauvais sens, mais une expérience différente. Mon troisième point est que j'ai lu des critiques, déclarant que le parc a des lignes de file d'attente incroyablement longues. Se plaindre de la file d'attente? Vous êtes à Disneyland Paris !!! Si vous allez aux heures de pointe, c'est à prévoir. Ce n'est pas un fait caché. Tirez le meilleur parti des passes rapides, allez aux manèges pendant le défilé un jour, arrivez tôt. Il y a de nombreuses façons autour de cela. La clé est de planifier votre journée. Mon quatrième point concerne le fait que les gens disent que ce parc peut être achevé en une journée? Est-ce que vous plaisantez? Une journée ici ne vous donnera même pas un goût assez bon pour à quel point ce parc est incroyable. Sans parler du fait, Walt Disney Studios est juste au coin de la rue! Le parc n'est pas aussi petit que les gens le prétendent. Les terres sont à thème unique et sont différentes des autres parcs du monde. Vous avez besoin de deux jours les plus grands pour vraiment obtenir la meilleure expérience ici. Il existe de nombreuses attractions. Certains peuvent ressembler à des promenades pour enfants, mais allez-y, allez tous sur eux! Mon cinquième point est en ce qui concerne la nourriture de Disneyland Paris. Pour commencer, lorsque vous comparez cela à l'Amérique, la nourriture est probablement meilleure en Amérique dans l'ensemble. La plupart des restaurants de Disneyland Paris ont tendance à être des fast-food, des hamburgers, des frites, des hot-dogs, etc. Avec cela étant dit, la nourriture n'est pas horrible. C'est de la bonne nourriture. Cela peut être cher, mais c'est l'euro pour vous. Si vous recherchez plus de repas, il y a beaucoup de bons restaurants dans et autour du parc, mais soyez prêt à être cher. En fin de compte, vous êtes à Disneyland. Attendez-vous à payer un peu plus. Mon plus grand conseil est, apportez votre propre nourriture. Si vous êtes préoccupé par le prix de la nourriture, il est essentiel que vous apportiez un déjeuner bondé. Rapprochez-vous de votre hôtel sur le petit déjeuner. Il y a des moyens des facteurs ronds comme où manger. Cela me met en colère, que les gens écrivent des critiques se plaignant de la façon dont la nourriture et de la file d'attente, et ce n'est pas comme la Floride a ruiné tout leur voyage. J'ai l'impression qu'ils sont venus vouloir que ce ne soit pas aussi bon et cherche des raisons pour critiquer ce merveilleux parc. Le parc a toujours coûté cher avec la nourriture, selon la période de l'année, il y a eu de longues files d'attente, ce n'est peut-être pas comme la Floride, il n'y a peut-être pas de dizaines de montagnes russes massives, mais toutes les manèges et attractions ici sont de première classe; Certains nettement meilleurs que la Floride, comme les pirates des Caraïbes, les gens doivent cesser de se plaindre des choses à prévoir. Si vous prenez une haute saison, ce sera occupé. Mais vous obtenez plus de divertissement. Il y aura des trucs en français, mais vous êtes en France, alors pourquoi n'y aura-t-il pas? Il y aura des files d'attente pour les manèges. Le parc sera très probablement occupé. Mais vous êtes dans un parc à thème. Qu'attendez-vous? Cet endroit est vraiment magique. La magie est là à chaque fois que je visite. Les manèges ne semblent que s'améliorer à chaque coup. Disneyland Paris s'améliore mois par mois. Les derniers rêves de Disney accordent un réel crédit aux efforts des Imagineers améliorant Disneyland Paris. Les gens doivent empêcher la crise du parc sans moyens justes ou justifiables. Je recommande vivement de visiter ici. Ce sera un voyage que vous n'oubliez jamais; Un magique à ça! --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"

            "Translation error: We choose to visit Disneyland in late January early February because of the special offer and lower attendance figures. We have visited the park before in July and it was hot and very, and in October and it was wet but not as busy. Early in the year is a good time to visit if you wrap up warm, the queues are short and the park is less crowdedWe spent a few days preparing for our visit by checking out the website and looking at park hours and closures so we could get the most from our trip. I also downloaded the iPhone app recommended on the official website so I could check wait times etc once in the park, it doesn   t work as there is very limited no signal in the parks, and even the staff said it was a waste of time as it doesn   t work. During our stay temperatures were hitting  9 and some of the outside attractions    went tec   . Half of Fantasyland was already closed for refurbishments, and Peter Pans Flight and Autopia were working occasionally despite the park guide saying they were closed, and Dumbo shut down because the hydraulics kept freezing up and the Dream Parade was cut down to three floats due to technical problems. Although busier than the Studios Park, the park was generally quiet during the week, the queues were a reasonable 5 20 minutes, and we often got to stay on rides or walk straight on. But at the weekend the park was much busier with queues up to 90 minutes for some rides and over 2 hours to see the Disney Princesses. We found that when the park opened at 8am for Extra Magic Hours, at around 9am there was a sudden surge of people, a cast member said if the park was quiet they let the general public in early. Space Mountain is much better in Paris than in Florida, and as it is one of the most popular rides the queues lines fill up quickly at weekends so try and ride them first last thing or use fastpass. We found the wait time was often as little as 5 10 minutes on weekdays, meaning you could easily ride it a couple of times. It is quite a vigorous ride, with a couple of 360 loops, but once you have re orientated yourself the scenery is spectacular. If the park is quiet and you have enough time I would recommend riding attractions with a lot of scenery e.g.    it   s a small world    twice so you can see them from both sides of the vehicle. Disney put a lot detail into the rides and it is easy to miss, and many of the    children   s    rides in Fantasyland would be even better at half the speed so that you can take it all in. One major difference between Disney in Florida and Paris was people smoking throughout the park, there are specified smoking areas but this is not upheld. There are also signs requesting no smoking in queue lines but we found this was ignored, especially outside. And although the park is generally clean you will see cigarette butts on the floor and if members of your parties are sensitive to smoke this may cause a problem. We enjoyed the Dreams parade, and got some great pictures of the characters in the first car when it stopped for nearly 20 minutes in front of us during (we think) a technical issue. The parade route does get quite congested, particularly at weekends, so use the passageways at the rear of the Main Street shops, especially if you have wheelchairs or pushchairs. Character meetings are still poorly managed at the Paris parks, although some permanent spots e.g. Town Square have queue lines, the others are a free for all and you may find you have to be very assertive if you want a picture autograph. During the colder weather you   ll find characters down the passageways behind the Main Street shops and they are often quieter and overlooked, and again it is much easier during the week than at weekends. The food is very expensive in the park, we had lunch at Agrabah Cafe and the food was poor and the service was worse, there is little choice and a small glass of Sprite was 4.20 Euros. The Plaza Garden has a buffet with more choice and the service was better, but make sure you make a reservation or you could end up standing out in the cold despite there being empty tables inside. We stopped at Casey   s Corner on Main Street for a snack, a hot dog or chicken nuggets will set you back 8 Euros. If you want a quick bite to eat try Cafe Hyperion in Discoveryland which is slightly better value, with a meal for around 10 Euros, and the children can watch cartoons on the cinema screens while you eat. The park is mostly flat and suitable for pushchairs or wheelchairs, and the wheelchair access is often through the attractions exit. If you are taking a wheelchair or you are pregnant make sure you take a Drs letter and get an Easy Access card from City Hall. The card usually only allows the card user and one person to gain    Easy Access    to an attraction, but if the park is quiet it   s always worth asking the cast member if you party is bigger if you can all ride together. We found the cast members were much stricter on the plus one rule at Disneyland park than in Studios and made two of our party use the main queue whilst our wheelchair user and plus one rode in empty vehicles. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"

            "Translation error: We booked to go to Paris from 12th 14th, arriving in the morning and flying home in the evening so we had 3 full days at the parks. We also booked the half board meal plan, so we did not have to worry about searching for somewhere to eat our evening meals. Things started to go wrong once we got to the hotel, where we discovered work was being done on our lodge, right outside our bedroom window, the workmen   s faces were right at our window, so we felt we had no privacy. The keys given to us were very temperamental and at one point we were locked outside our room for over half an hour, eventually we were given new keys. The bath and shower did not work, so we were unable to bath shower the whole time we were there, which was very uncomfortable and there were no drinks facilities or anywhere to store cold drinks either. I have never been in a hotel that does not offer either a fridge or kettle, and for the amount it costs to stay at Disney, to not have basics was unsatisfactory. In the brochure and at the hotel it says that there are Disney channels for the children to watch in the rooms, the English Disney channel did not work in our room, much to the disappointment of our children, only the news and the information channel worked.On our second night I mentioned my thoughts to the concierge hoping that some of this may be sorted out for us, especially the bath water, however nothing was done and we received no apology from management, we were just given a booklet to fill in for internal use only asking about our stay in Disney and what we liked best.As I mentioned earlier we booked the half board menu, which I deeply regretted. In the past I had heard that the food was fantastic, I now realise that they were talking about Disney land in America! Paris may share the name Disney, however I feel that the standards are extremely miles apart. Our children did not enjoy their meals and the only fresh items on my husbands and my plate were the meat. The vegetables were either out of a tin or had previously been cooked and re heated, they were soft and soggy, the service in the hotel was good though. For the second meal we decided to eat in the Disney Village to see if the food was any better, yet another reget! We went to the Steakhouse, which looked to be of a high standard. Table booked for 9.15, seated at 9.30 and were brought our drinks at 10.10pm. The kids were served their main meal before we were even served our starter. Both our daughters left their meals, one was raw in the middle the other was just horrible to taste and when our starters arrived, Cesar salad, we were extremely let down, lettuce which was old and the leaves were brown, half a cherry tomato and parmesan shavings with a little dressing. We sat and waited ages for them to be taken away, the waiter looked at the plates and could see we were not happy and not eating but did nothing to care why? My husband and I ordered steak, as we were in a steakhouse we had thought that it should be good, how wrong we were. The waiters decided to serve the table next to us their steaks even though they had arrived much after us, they saw we were looking and not too happy so they brought two of the steaks to us, as my husband started to cut the steak, he saw it was well done, he had asked for medium rare, so the waiter took one off the next table and swapped the steaks, I cut into mine and that was not right either, again the waiter just swapped with another person on the next table, none of us could believe our eyes. As one of my daughters had not eaten any of her food, I gave her some of my steak, which she nearly choked on as it was so chewy, most of the meals were left.We then asked for desert hoping that may be edible, I asked if on my crumble I could have custard instead of ice cream, he said custard is for children and no I could not have it, even though it was available. The only item that was wholly consumed was the Ben and Jerrys ice cream, a few bread rolls and our drinks. When we went to pay for our drink and hand in our meal tickets, I tried to speak to a woman their about our meal and she just looked at me and walked away, the receipt showed the meal came to 95 euro and if I had not already pre paid I can say that I would not have paid for that shambolic meal. I prepaid   160.00 for two evening meals which I deeply regret and will think twice about it in the future. I would just like to say that my experience at Disneyland Paris was unforgettable for all the wrong reasons, it was meant to be the holiday of a lifetime, but we could not wait to get home, the service has let the Disney name down, I was hoping to come back from my holiday to have lots of great things to say however I feel that the bad far outweighed the good.The best part of the trip were the studios. I think that it should have the disney name stripped, as I am sure Disney himself would be ashamed if he took a visit there, it is awful to say we learn by mistakes, mine was a costly one, the good thing is we have some great photos! --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"

            "Translation error: I travelled with my wife and our two sons (8 and 6) at the end of May and had 4 days 3 nights there. We went on the Eurostar from Ebbsfleet station, which still looks brand new. You can park very close by for   8 a day. It   s a very slick operation and they tell you where to stand on the platform so you can enter the correct coach for your reserved seating. The Eurostar train itself was disappointing     our train was rather grubby and we were not overly pleased to be sitting backwards all the way. There are two buffet cars but they are hopeless     I had to queue up for 30 minutes in an effort to buy very expensive drinks and snacks, but by the time I got to the counter they had sold out of almost everything. We booked late at a busy time so could not take the Eurostar all the way to Disneyland, so instead we took the Eurostar to Lille and then changed for a high speed TGV train. This was a double decker train, much smarter than the Eurostar. An hour and 15 minutes later we were off the train and we emerged right in the middle of it all! Disney Village has most of the restaurants and bars, it is a very short walk from the station and the two theme parks are just past the village. Turn left and there is a row of bus stops with free shuttle buses every 12 minutes to take you to your hotel. We stayed at the Cheyenne, it   s not luxurious but it is more than adequate and good fun. The hotel rooms are arranged in buildings much like a Wild West town, our family room had a double bed and a bunk bed for the boys. Colour TV and bath shower but no tea coffee facilities     you can buy a basket for    7 for 2 or 3 drinks but it would be best to bring your own travel kettle. You are offered a choice of times for your breakfast: 7, 8 or 9am. We chose the 7am sitting as we wanted to be in the park when it opened at 8am for the Extra Magic Hours (10am start if you are not staying at Disney). You have an excellent selection of cold meats, cheeses, yoghurts, croissants and 4 cereals, and you can go back for as much as you want. Everyone takes rolls in their bags for lunch and nobody minds. I love a decent cup of coffee but the black coffee at Disneyland was poor     but the caf   au lait was really nice. You can help yourself to hot drinks and fruit juices too. Breakfast quickly gets very busy and has been likened to a bun fight but it   s all good natured!We went first into the Magic Kingdom, and it is immaculately clean and tidy. They have happy music playing in the background but are clever enough to hide the speakers from view. As you enter the park under the railway station you head up Main Street which is full of beautiful buildings and shops. This can get crowded so we followed another reviewer   s tip to walk up through one of the arcades on either side of Main Street as they are much less crowded and you can get to the rides more quickly! You have to check on the weekly programme which rides are open early, there are only about 6 until the park opens properly at 10am. It   s worth going in early as the crowds are reasonable at that time of day. Our boys    favourite rides were Buzz Lightyear and Small World. We tried several times to get a train ride around the park but the queues were so long. And even when we got near the head of the queue, not many people got off the train so we gave up waiting in the end.There are loads of restaurants around, or you can eat at your hotel. It costs about    70 for two courses for a family of 4, without drinks, although table water is free. The price is much the same everywhere within Disneyland so go prepared! Again, our hotel had a magnificent choice of dishes but some of them could have been hotter. And as it   s a buffet you can go back for as much as you want. We did have a burger and chips for lunch one day, with a soft drink, and this cost about    40 for the four of us. The parks close at 10pm at the weekend and 7pm on a weekday. On the Monday at 7pm the crowds descended on Disney Village and queued out of the doors for the restaurants, so it is definitely worth booking a table earlier on that day.We did splash out on the Buffalo Bill Wild West Show. This is pretty entertaining with real horses and buffalo and they feed you a cowboy supper at the same time. Not masses of food but enough to eat, and free lager too! We arrived an hour early upon someone   s recommendation as they have pre show entertainment in the bar which is worth seeing, a gun slinger and a 3 piece country band. I bought a pint of lager, a pint of shandy and two fruit juices for    18. You are presented with a cowboy hat which you get to keep. The hats have a coloured band and you are encouraged to cheer for the cowboy wearing your colour. You are allocated a long table and you choose your own seats on that table. The tickets for the show cost    208 (  180) for the 4 of us and it was good, but I   m not sure we got full value for money. This was for the cheaper Category B tickets     no point paying extra for the better seats as you get a great view where ever you sit.The Walt Disney Film Studios park seems aimed at a slightly older visitor. It   s not as big as the Magic Kingdom but still plenty to see. We thought the car stunt show was excellent but I was a bit disappointed with the tram ride     the tanker disaster was very good but the London street disaster was just a static display. You have to do the Crush Coaster ride it is excellent! The Toy Soldiers parachute drop is good fun and I went on the Aerosmith Rock    n    Rollercoaster with our elder son, this is even better than Space Mountain. We would not recommend the Slinky Dog ride as it took 20 minutes to queue up, then it takes 2 or 3 minutes for the staff to unload load the passengers, and finally you get a tame ride lasting just 57 seconds!The Fastpass system worked well for us, you insert your park tickets in the machine and then you come back at a pre allocated time slot and can then skip most of the queuing. The queues were mostly 10 20 minutes long, and about 50 minutes for Crush   s Coaster but that is worth the wait!There is a daily parade in each park, and we found these excellent. In the film studios park they put on a song and dance show around the Place des Stars so it would be worth siting yourself around this area. We would recommend taking a position one hour before each parade to be sure of a front row view point.All the Disney staff (Cast Members) were excellent, they were very polite, cheerful and helpful, and they all speak English too. We did some shopping and the girl was kind enough to offer to have our items delivered to our hotel. You have to spend    30 or more, be staying in a Disney hotel and it needs to be before 3pm for this free service. It was a nice touch so we were not lugging around too many bags.We prepared well for our trip having read all about it on Trip Advisor. When we went they had a heatwave over there, we hadn   t packed shorts and they don   t sell any in the shops there. We knew it was going to be expensive so we allowed for that, all the prices seem double what we pay in the UK, but we had a fantastic time and would certainly recommend it. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"

            "Translation error: Visited Disney 21st   25th March 2011 .. my husband and I and our 3   year old little boy. I use tripadvisor all the time so feel its only fair to write a report. Airport   CDG .. if you want to go to disney via Disney Bus this is realy simple .. follow all the signs for Disneyland Paris... they are all over the airport .. this is the VEA and is the official Disney shuttle. There are alot of  others  but heard a few bad reports on ripping you off .. so I wouldnt bother. It would have cost us 102 euro return for the three of us and takes I believe 45 mins .. but there is a website so you might want to check. We chose TGV .. takes 10 mins .. cost   75 for the three of us .. return .. you have to have your wits about you .. get the shuttle to terminal 2 in the airport then you can get the TGV from there .. we did it purely for cost and for the fact its 10mins, there is a website so you can suss times before you go and book, we didnt book our tickets because you never know with planes being late etc! Takes you into the disney station which is literally next to all the bus stops for the disney hotels and disney is on the right. Everything is very very close to each other. So we found the bus stop for Hotel Cheyenne and waited. Along came the bus on we got .. stood for around 2 mins and then we were at the hotel .. amazing! The ease of the buses provided with your hotel is great for your holiday. Hotel Cheyenne is great .. its clean its basic yes, ranch style , towels changed every day and maid service with beds every day .. which I was impressed with to say its one of the cheaper hotels .. the room had loads of storage space absolutely loads!! 32  flatscreen tv with english channels, not that we watched it .. too tired ha! lovely bathroom with disney toiletries which were a nice touch .. no hairdryer or kettle so I took my own little travel kettle (will get onto that later!) .. but you can hire kettles, hairdryers and all sorts so if you dont want to take its fine. Only complaint I have is we were on a first floor with a buggy .. going fine .. but after a long 12 hour day at the park (!!) you are soo tired so getting up the stairs with the buggy took alot of energy ha! Big double bed and bunk beds in room.. great. We were in block 25. The hotels are huge! We were given info pack on arrival and told about happy hours .. which are 8   10 (not sure if this is winter months   i.e. might be at night as well as summer comes) .. asked what time we would want breakfast every day so we said 7.30 but we could change at any time. Told about buses to the park and basically given everything we need to know .. really good reception service. So next day we went to brekky or should I say the SCRUM ha! you realise how many people are staying when you walk in at 7.30 and the place is PACKED!!! Food, croissants, rolls, cheeses ham, cereal, fruit etc ... lots of people making sandwichs for the day and filling up there juice bottles!!! Everyone does it so dont feel worried about being caught! ha! Then off we went for the bus .. and to disney for our first day! Disney is magical .. Studio open 10   6 and Park open 8 (magic hours for disney hotel people 10 for joe public) till 8pm. Disney Village   where all the restaurants are open till late .. 11pm I think if not later. This is next to the parks. Food around disney .. hot dogs 8 euros, bottle of water 3 euros. There are no juices for little people .. not that we saw .. fizzy pop (coke etc) and water but no juice just so you know. There a no sweets choc either unless you want to buy a disney bag of sweets 6 euro .. so I think you get my drift. There are some nice coffee shops on main street in the park .. the mickey mouse chocolate brioche is scrummy have to say .. 3 euros but worth it for a treat! The  vineopolis  people walk by because its a place where you can sit and watch cartoons but in there is a great take away .. burger fries and a drink 10 euros .. which trust me is good ha! Takes a while to get your head around the food prices! I had read alot of reviews before I went and to be fair it can get confusing. Basic rule is food and drinks are expensive! We were only taking hand luggage but I decided that cost of a case vs food price would be cheaper! now .. i am a flask and sandwichs girl so .. I took cartons of juice .. chocolate .. cheese and biscuits .. even took a loaf cobs and some cheese spread for sarnis .. cakes .. crisps .. tea coffee longlife milk (for room and for flask in the day)   no im not kidding ha ha .. food bags and generally made pack up every morning .. saved a bomb! Now you may be thinking it cant me that expensive .. so ok .. one day my hubby wanted hot dog so .. 1 hot dog .. and three drinks .. 19 euros. Ben and jerrys 3 scoops 5 euros. Dont get me wrong I dont mind paying but I hate being ripped off and im really not tight .. its just you are such a captive audience that they can charge what they want. I was so pleased I had juice and choc crisps for my little boy. take thsoe if nothing else! Ok food at night .. well i'd read about the meal vouchers you can buy and thought quite pricey around   65 for the three of us a night for 1 meal. But I have to say .. if you want a big meal and alot of choice they are really good ... and I would recommend. We didnt buy them but I would for next time. We ate in Annettes Diner first night .. 2 beers 1 juice two burgers chips and a kids meal hotdog chips 58 euros. Annettes Diner do a take away ... we were very lucky that the weather was amazing and warm so one night we had that .. its scrummy .. 10 euros burger chips and kids 7 euros.. so we sat outside and ate that. There is a mcdonalds in the disney village it was absolutely packed and I think its because its the cheapest place on there! 7euros for a meal. Cost 20 euro for two meals and a happy meal. Alot of the restaurants are all you can eat about 25   30 euros each plus drinks on top. So when you consider the food vouchers its a cheaper as they are for 3 courses and a drink   unless you want mcdonalds every night. Your call really on how much you want to spend! We are not that food precious and will eat anything so were happy with spending our pennies on things to take back with us and fun stuff for our little boy. Beer 7 euros pint. Buggy .. you can hire when there .. have no idea on price but to say they dont look like a normal buggy is an understatement .. i would take your own definitely. All in all it was an amazing trip .. we got the TGV back to CDG and it was painless. Disney is amazing .. completely .. I wouldnt change a thing apart from probably buy meal vouchers for at night .. even I couldnt cater for that ha ha .. enjoy every second!! --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"

            "Translation error: we just returned from our weekend at the Euro Disney Resort in Paris and we still are in shock about our experience there. We are great Disney fans and have traveled to parks worldwide and have already spent various vacations at the Resorts in Orlando and Anaheim. We have been very much excited to return to Paris, after been there in the opening week some years ago and the only thing we got in return was disappointment.We could not believe what was called Disney Village. We have never seen such a run down place before! It started with holes and giant cracks in the concrete everywhere, faded building facades, nothing to do for Kids, not even a playground was accessible. Entertainment was a not existent, even though they had announced a rock and roll party with car shows that day. Besides the Disney shops, little electric race cars which were not operated, a Balloon ride inside the resort lake for an additional 15 Euros per Person was available. We looked at some cars displayed and at 6pm a couple of kids started dancing on a little stage. To our disappointment, that was the entire party! We decided to have dinner at the rainforest cafe. No reservation required that evening so we got great seat but were also disappointed by the bad quality of food and the high prices. (For a starter plate and a fish course we paid 60 euros!) On our way out to the car we were held up by Souvenir sellers, trying to make us buy cheap metal Eifel towers. Next Morning we came back to enjoy the parks. We arrived there shortly before 10 am and the line in front of the security gates were so long, we decided to enter through the Walt Disney Studios. After a 20 minute wait and a baggage check that did not really include looking through bags, we were able to proceed through the ticket entrance into the Studio Park. The first ride we were heading to was the Crusher  s coaster. We arrived there at 10 Minutes after ten and were confronted with an 80 Minute wait. We thought this is because this attraction in new so we walked in to the RC Racer roller coaster. The line there appeared to be shorter so we got in. Right behind us a family was waiting and their child that got sick while standing in line. It took quite a while and lots of yelling until they got some help from the personnel working on this ride and were let out of the queue. The coaster was stopped during that episode because one of the operators had to assist the family. After a one Minute ride we attended a stunt show which was nice and around 11.30 we wondered back to the Disney Park  this was after we decided to proceed since the waiting time for all rides in the Studio Park were between 70 and 80 minutes, the Tower of terror had been closed due to technical problems and the crowd was getting exceptionally high. We entered the Disneyland Park and were literally shoved through Main Street. We were not able to walk freely so many people had been let in. We thought it was because it was lunch time and everybody had returned to main street  but we were proven wrong. Waiting time Big Thunder Mountain, was again 80 Minutes   and with fast pass option they asked you to return at 6.45 pm!!!. To make a long story short, after a lousy lunch, not being able to walk freely in the park due to the monstrous mount of people and incredible waiting times at every attraction (there was even an hour waiting time to hop onto the park train! Peter Pans Flight, had a waiting time over 120 minutes or, with fast pass, return at 9.30 pm   and it was noontime and so forth) we decided to go back to our hotel and to return in the evening when things were slowing down. We came back at 5 pm and encountered the same run of people, so we returned again at 7.30 pm. Discovery land was still overcrowded with waiting times at the attractions still over 80 minutes. So we went to see the Pirates of the Caribbean waiting time here, an acceptable 40 Minutes and it had just turned 8 pm. After a fun ride, we wanted to hop on to the Indianer Jones roller coaster, but with our arrival were informed that the ride had already been closed. After us asking why they close down the rides before they close down the Park at 10pm, the gentleman replied that he just does what he is told to and we should read the sings  and yes, there were signs that some attractions close before the park closes. Bad luck for us. We had payed full price ticket and all we got was a roller coaster ride, a stunt show, a unejoyable expensive lunch, a long afternoon at the hotel, 2 bus rides to return to the park and in the end a Pirates Ride and lot and lot and lots of people! One more thing we would like to mention at this point, the lighting at night was disastrous! All light came from little decoration lanterns but no lights in bushes, stairs or stronger street lights  I  m in my mid 30ies and I was not able to see the steps I had to go down properly! I can  t imagine what would have happened if your child would have run off or if it had gotten lost.  What really lifted this experience to something even more indescribable was the fact that we visited the Parks on September 11th and at this memorable date we had somehow expected a more elaborated precaution and security concept. We still cannot understand why so many people had been let in and if something would have happened we do not know how help could have been able to reach us. Thanks to this experience we did not return to the parks the next day, and will probably not return to Disney again. The sad thing, we met many other families also stating how disappointed they were and how their kids hated the Parks. We still don  t want to believe how disappointing this trip was, what a tourist trap Euro Disney is and how disrespectful we were treated! --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"

            "Translation error: Nous avons récemment visité Disney Paris pendant 3 fois et nous sommes allés aux parcs aux États-Unis à plusieurs reprises. (Nous sommes des vétérans de Disney ayant été environ 10 fois en tout) à l'exception possible de la nourriture dans le lagon bleu (ce qui est assez bon) Les parcs ne se comparent pas bien. Notre visite la plus récente à Paris a été gâtée par: les attractions se décomposent; Presque toutes les principales attractions sont tombées en panne lors de nos visites Pirates des Caraïbes, Buzz Lightyear, Big Thunder Mountain, Back Lot Tour, certains d'entre eux ayant des problèmes réguliers le jour où nous y étions. Aucune excuse du personnel, même lorsque nous avons été piégés dans le trajet des Pirates pendant 30 minutes. Back Lot Tour a continué sans commentaire. Le parc a une file d'attente endémique sans intérêt du personnel. Nous avons rencontré une grossièreté, l'un des personnages a frappé un visiteur qui a tiré sur son manteau pour attirer l'attention pour une photo quand il considérait clairement que son passage était terminé! Je n'ai jamais vu du personnel aussi grossier et arrogant qu'à Paris. Ma fille a été un peu lente sur un trajet en train de réduire la retenue (rocher et roller coaster), donc un membre du personnel l'a fait et, ce faisant, a piégé son bras dans la retenue qu'elle n'a pas remarquée. Nous sommes allés dans plus de parcs à thème et sur plus de manèges que je peux compter, et nous n'avons jamais eu de mauvais traitements même à des prix beaucoup plus bas ou à des organisations moins estimées. Nous avons réservé un petit-déjeuner de personnage dans le village, à 24 euros par adulte, et nous étions un peu en retard (5 minutes), donc mes filles se sont précipitées pendant que nous n'avions pas rangé le tableau à la station lorsque ils sont arrivés au restaurant avec un billet avant réservé, ils n'avaient pas permis le tableau sans paiement pour le repas! Ils ont donc dû se frayer un chemin vers une table à attendre quand je suis arrivé 5 minutes plus tard (toujours dans les 15 minutes de grâce autorisée), j'ai entendu parler de cela et je suis sorti pour prendre le petit déjeuner ailleurs en outre, il s'agit d'un restaurant buffet sans service à table, donc le prix est élevé pour un point de vente de village minable. Nous avons regardé le buffet et avons également noté qu'il n'y avait pas de crêpes et que c'est donc un petit-déjeuner assez standard à un prix très élevé. Nous avons acheté des billets (prix élevé bien sûr) sur Internet sur Disney, vous imprimez et prenez le parc. Il y avait une longue file d'attente comme d'habitude pour les billets, j'ai donc montré les billets pré-imprimés pour le personnel et ils nous ont pointé de la file d'attente des billets pour perdre plus de temps pendant 30 minutes, nous avons ensuite remarqué la porte pour les billets pré-imprimés et l'avons utilisé, ils ne connaissaient tout simplement pas la procédure. Les billets sont douloureux, cependant, car le scanner a eu des difficultés avec le code à barres. Ma femme avait besoin d'emmener de la nourriture et des médicaments dans le parc, et pour plus de commodité, nous utilisons un petit sac de report avec roues, de la taille d'un petit pack de dos mais avec des roues. Nous n'avons eu aucun problème avec cela pendant la majeure partie de la journée, en passant entre les deux parcs (nous avions des billets Hopper), mais à environ 18 heures, le personnel a décidé qu'il comptait un risque de sécurité (l'ont fait inspecter au chèque du sac). Ils ont donc demandé à le réserver dans le stockage à 6 euros et nous avons dû gérer du mieux que nous pouvions avec la médecine. Les toilettes du meilleur restaurant puent les eaux usées en raison de l'ancien style de toilettes ou de drainage. Nous l'avons eu avant en avril lors de notre dernière visite, ce n'est donc pas un 0ne. La dernière visite, les toilettes ont été bloquées et lorsque je l'ai signalé au directeur de restaurant, il a haussé les épaules et a dit qu'ils ne sont pas ses toilettes! Le crâne négligez-vous sur le lac puant de l'urine. La fumée est autorisée dans le parc si souvent que vous mangerez ou que la file d'attente à côté de quelqu'un qui fume. de sorte que malgré les files d'attente d'une heure pour les manèges, les voitures sont parties non remplies ou remplies de beaucoup d'espace. Eh bien, si vous devez aller à Paris, ne vous attendez pas à ce qu'il corresponde à la convivialité, aux soins ou à la qualité des États-Unis. Les files d'attente seront aussi longues ou plus longues (elles mentent à peu près le temps car nous avons souvent chronométré vous-mêmes 40 minutes revendiquées sur la grande montagne Thunder était près de 75 minutes en réalité). Les habitants obtiennent de meilleures offres que vous ne pouvez facilement trouver sur le site Disney Pay un jour, obtenez le deuxième jour gratuit, par exemple, est largement annoncé localement, mais vous ne pouvez pas trouver de réelles réelles sur le site Disney, autre qu'une petite remise d'environ 15% pour la réservation en ligne. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"

            "Translation error: Having jsut come back from DLP I was amazed that the scores of reviews I read on the web never told you what you really need to know if going to DLP with you children. We went over a weekend in early August, 2010, two adults and two children (3 and 5).Never go in the sumnmer hols and especiallly never at a weekend. The park is mobbed. They let in 10 times more people than the park can handle. We went on 3 rides in 2 days!!! The queues were that bad.Be aware that there is absolutely nothing there for toddlers. The crucial height restrictions are 1.2m and 1.4m. There really is nothing there for toddlers, a couple of pathetic rides (teacups!)for those up to 1m, a couple more pretty pathetic things for those above 1.2m but to get on 90% of the rides you have to be over 1.40m. Consequently, a visit is pointless with children under 1.40m (ie below about 7 years old).It is expensive, but that's no surprise.The park is massive but there is very little in it. Expect to walk for miles for very little return. Actual rides and attractions probably take up less than 2% of the entire surface area of the park. Disney's plan has cklearly been to fit as many people as possible into the park without any concern that there is nothing for the crowds to do once inside.The queues are truly horrendous. Expect to queue for between 1   2 hours for every ride. I had read this before I went and had assumed that the queus would be for the big thrill rides bit no one would queue for the sorts of things my 3 and 5 year old would want to go on. I was very wrong. As there is nothing for the young, the teacups and the carousel, the sort of basic rides you would find at any town fair in the UK, had queues of up to 2 hours!!! With hot, bored, tired children the scenes were horrendous. I canlt believe people put themselves through this and that no one onTrip Advisor or anyone else points out these horrors out.We were satying at the Sante Fe Hotel, which was very basic (just an accomodation block), but functional enough. We had tickets for 3 days but only stayed for 2 days as the experience was so awful. You simply can't have fun in those crowds, that heat, that much walking and so much queing for so little. For example, we queued for 1 hour to go on the carpets over Agra ride, a grand name for a simple toddlers fairground ride. I timed the ride. It lasted 1 minute 20 seconds. We had qeued for an hour!Make sure you bring a pushchair, you will need it. You can rent shopping trolley like pushchairs at the park for 9 euros per day but make sure you keep a hold of your receipt because people will nick your pushchair when it's parked! If you have your receipt you can at least go back and complain and get given another one (we had our pushchair nicked twice in 2 days!)Re food and drink, it's all junk food and coke. It is not possible to buy milk anywhere inside, outside or within miles of the park! If you do find some, it will be UHT milk.Bizarrely enough, children make up about 5% of the vistors to the park! The vast majority of visitors are adults from across Europe and lots of couples in theire 20's and 30's. Whether they were simple before they arrived , I don't know, but once there they seem to forget the normal structure and behaviour of adults in society. They visit all the rides. Whilst standing in line for small, basic funfair rides like the teacups and a carousel, suitable for those up to 5, I was amazed that 80% of the queue was made up of adults without children or adults with teenagers... to go on toddlers rides!!!!!!!!! This bizarre behaviour is repeated across the park.But queing is the name of the game there. You queue for everything, for hours. Before the parades start, people start queuubng and sitting down about 1 hour before! The park is not designed to enable you to see anything. Imagine a nor mal falt street with a parade on it, unless you are kerbside, you see nothing.The fantilusion parade is quite nice to watch but it starts at 10.30pm, ideal for toddlers   NOT! it lasts 30 minutes, then there ios a load of faffinf around and then the fireworks start at about 11.10pm. The fireworks are lovely, but what child can stay awake until that time. Our children are always up late, but with the heat, drudgery and qeueuing they were fast asleep and had been begging to be taken home hours before..All in all, I would strongly advise that you don't go to DLP. It's all hype. The actual experieince is tortorous at worst and deeply disappointing at best. There is absolutely nothing there for children under 1.40m, even if there were no queues and the park was empty, there still wouldn't be anything for young children to do. The three toddlers rides they have are teacups, a carousel and one other standard fairground ride. However, Disney have placed these rides in hard landscaping, given them a fancy name and tried to build some hype sround what are in fact utterly bog standard funfair rides that you will see in aat any county town fair in the UK, and whihc you can ride for 2 quid without qeueing.My children were so excited about going but when we got there, they were the first to want to leave. We had tickets for 3 days but left after 2 days deeply disappointed. In fact mad, because we then went on to Burgundy for the rest of our 7 day holiday. It was amazing, the beuaty and interet of the unspoilt hsitoric environment was incredible and served only to remind us how we had wasted 2 days of our lives at DLP.All in all, if you are simple, and an adult and like queuing, you may enjoy yourself.If you want your children to have fun, then take them to funfair in the UK and spoil them for a couple of hours. They will have much more fun and you will save hundreds of pounds. But whatever you do, don't believe the hype about DLP, it's all garbage. Incredibly, the place is utterly unsuited to children of pre teen age. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"

            "Translation error: Just returned from a three night, four day stay at Disney Paris and felt compelled to write a review to balance out some of the VERY negative stuff that has been reported on this site, stuff which really bothered me PRIOR to our stay.Firstly we were blessed with a full three days of splendid March weather, sunny all day and warm, too warm for coats at times! Without doubt the weather helps create the Magic, on our fourth day we experienced heavy rain, lightning and rainbows, and to be fair I can imagine that four full days of that would have considerably reduced our smiles. So yes, I think to some extent as we all know the experience is weather dependant and March will always be unreliable, a risk, but a far more affordable risk!! We were blessed.The other MAJOR concern with this stay and based upon reviews is EXPENSE. But I was pleasantly surprised to be fair. The pound is poor, but thats not the fault of Disney Paris, the prices there are typical, even more inflated Theme park Prices. Food and Drink in particular are pricey, soft drinks hot drinks 2.50Euros, hotdogs 6.00Euros, muffins, brownies, popcorn candy floss etc etc all at least 2.50Euros. Merchandise and souvenirs are literally everywhere and prices here are also inflated, soft toys (medium size) 20 Euros, mugs 9.00Euros, fancy dress outfits 35 Euros. But to be fair the kids adore all this stuff and we spent many a minute milling through the same merchandise which is replicated a thousand times over in every store. And there are many many stores! So its pricey, but there is a mas of choice and the stores are an experience in themselves. They also provide welcome relief from the rain. We saved up and gave our daughter her own spending money for merchandise and snacks. To put it in perspective she took 130Euros and spent 95Euros and managed to buy realistically all the things she set her heart on.Mealtimes are probably the worst of the expense. We purchased pre paid Half Board Vouchers beforehand ( recommended to me) and I cannot emphasize how handy these are and the value for money they represent and the peace of mind they afford, knowing that you have paid up front and budgeted in advance. In effect they purchase your lunch or evening meal daily, they can be used at limited outlets, but always include your own hotel (Disney Hotels), and quite simply take all the stress out of finding somewhere to eat, because they limit your choice, meaning you only need to focus on a few choices instead of way too many!! To be fair we found that at the end of each evening we happily returned to our hotel to eat, it was by then nice to leave the Park, the rides, the shops, the queues behind, and believe me the need to sit down is strong! To put mealtimes in perspective, our Hotel Cheyenne (a cheaper Hotel) evening meal was rung up on the till nightly at 50Euros each for an EAT ALL YOU CAN BUFFET. That would be the cost without the prepaid Half Board Vouchers. And to eat ANYWHERE would be at least 50Euros per head, and considerably more in the likes of the more popular Rainforset Cafes and Planet Hollywoods. Add to this a pint of beer at 6.00Euros and a small glass of wine at 5.00Euros and soft drinks at 2.50Euros and you can quickly see how expensive mealtimes can become. My advice is purchase Half Board Vouchers for peace of mind in advance, eat at your Hotel in the evening to relax away from the Magic ( providing its decent) and purchase snacks in the parks during the day if required, but to be fair if you fill up with Hotel Breakfast instead, this won't cost too much.For lunchtime Snacks, Caseys Famous Hot dog stall shop, corner of Main Street is multi functional, providing reasonable hotdogs, provides a welcome place to sit and soak up the sun and the Magic, and importantly is ideally situated (from the slightly raised perimeter wall) to view the Main Street Parades and the Disney Showtime Spectacular at the Sleeping Beauty Castle in the distance. You can get closer but you really don't need to. If you go here order childrens meals even for ADULTS, you get a hotdog and an ice cream and a drink for 4.95Euros, as opposed to a single unaccompanied hotdog for 6Euros!! KEEP YOUR EYE ON THE CHILDRENS DEALS, they are often far better value for money. Macdonalds too in Disney Village, (love it or hate it) cost 15Euros for two medium burger meals and a happy meal, and is about as cheap as you will get for lunch dinner anywhere.We took 300Euros for the 4 days for snacks and merchandise etc (thats aside from our daughters 130 Euros.) I am glad to say we returned with 135Euro, she with 40Euros, so it can be done, and we are neither compulsive spenders nor meanies, we just bought what we wanted needed and we managed pretty well.The Parks are a joy, a delight for adults and children alike, and I defy anyone not to feel the magic of being a child again. I have some snaps of my daughter during this visit and the expression on her 6 year old face is priceless, expressions which to be fair I am not sure that I have seen before, and have certainly never captured. True enchantment. The money is probably money well spent for that alone (or am I just getting TOO caught up in the Magic??) You decide.Ride queues were not too unbearable, though as leg, back and feet ache sets in later in the day, they become increasingly daunting! Most typically ride times were 20 mins, the longest annoyingly but understandably are the small child rides, Dumbo in particular, which is slow, but compulsive for the little ones. Use your Magic Hours in Fantasyland if you have little ones and the Magic Hours apply here, most of the little rides are here, though only a selection were open each day for Magic Hours (8am 10am). You need to get on these before the public enter at 10am if you can. In Fantasyland  Its a Small world  is a joy and has short queues, and Peter Pans Flight is also worth a go.Interestingly the larger more adult rides had relatively short queues, often 10 minutes. So its a question of splitting the party up so you all get to go on as much as possible for your money, you won't fit enough in any other way. Big Thunder Mountain is a great mid level Family Ride, but was notoriously unreliable and broke down 3 times on 3 seperate days that we were in the queue. Nightmare!Disney Studio Park has some decent entertainment too (in fact we spent every afternoon here). Rock and Roller Coaster is a great ride and the queue never went above 5 mins. The Magic Carpets ride is a must for little ones (we spent more time on this than any other  and the queue was a manageable 15mins at most). Tower Of Terror is not for me but my other half raved about it. I also recommend the Moteurs Stunt show, Lilo and Stitch Interactive show and Tram Tours (this was closed during our visit but It has been recommended to me).In terms of Character Meet and Greets, we didn't experience the pushiness and arrogance described by other reviewers. In fact most adults were very considerate towards ALL children and prioritised their needs to meet the characters. Some kids were a little pushy there was a smallscale scrum for autographs, but to be fair I genuinely put that down to overexcitement rather than arrogance. Noticeably the characters have time slots, so once the time is up they leave, likewise if it starts to pour with rain, they leave. But I never saw them be rude. Firm but fair to me. I fail to see what is unreasonable about this, its all down to the luck of the draw, some characters you get to meet, some you miss, some you just miss because they need to move on. My daughter missed some one day, caught them the next, some she never got to see. Thats life, thats management of a theme park. I think to be fair too that maybe during March the scrumming is simply less because crowds are less, that said the stay was still very busy and crowded, but not unbearably so.We encountered absolutely delightful French Staff in all sections of the Park and Hotel. We found them to be helpful, charming, very child orientated, in fact they tried hard to contribute to the Magic. The Park is maintained spotlessly, you won't see litter, its maintenence is run with clockwork efficiency (except the daily parade always seemed to be ten mins late!!!) , yet the Magic is still there in the theming, the characters and the joy of the children.In summary and contrary to expectations (many based upon this site), we thoroughly enjoyed this experience from start to finish. I can only recommend those things we experienced, but I recommend them wholeheartedly. In summary and worth noting:Eurostar from Ashford International was easy and efficient (if expensive). Parking is   11.50 daily too! Premier Inn at Ashford was convienient, practical and very local, about ten mins from the Eurostar station for an overnight stay    57.00 per family room.Hotel Cheyenne was a joy, basic, a cheaper option than some but fit for its purpose, superbly themed and I wouldn't feel the need to upgrade having seen the other more expensive options. I would stay there again without a moments thought. And they have bunkbeds! Evening buffets are a little chaotic, but manageable, if you get there by 7pm at latest, and you will NEED to SIT DOWN for the day by then. Don't expect fine dining and candlelight, its cheap cheerful, mass produced, but edible and convienient, and for four days you can cope without moaning.Pre Purchase Half Board Vouchers for mealtimes. If you do nothing else I recommend, just do this.FantasyLand is a must see but EARLY see for little ones.Thoroughly recommend the Prebooked Character Breakfast at Cafe Mickey. Again expensive and food was adequate but not fab. But this was about meeting Mickey and Co, and you get to meet them close up and personal at your table, no scrums, no heads in the way on your pics, true personal time to share, the little ones loved it. ( And I did but don't tell).March was superb. A risky time to visit granted weather wise, but fewer crowds, better vantage points, less scrumming, more tolerant staff and PARENTS, better access to characters, shorter ride times......Happy Families. The best variety of charcaters were in Disney Studio Park, it was also easier to access these characters here since as a rule the park is less busy. Meet and Greets here were easier. Take some comfortable shoes. I'll leave that one with you, all will become apparent.Magical. Try it. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"

            "Translation error: I am very disappointed that i have to write this complaint, but we were very unsatisfied with our stay at Santa Fe Hotel, Disneyland Paris from 6th November '09 to 8th Novemever '09. We went especially for our child's first birthday as we wanted it to be a special, magical day for him.  There were numerous issus that arose over our weekend at Disneyland Paris, and feel that these should be reported and followed up. As a customer and mother I do not agree how these issues could of occured on our visit and am disgusted that Disneyland Paris allow such rude and unfriendly attitudes towards their paying customers. Firstly, when we arrived we were given a room on the first floor of which there was no lift for us to take the pram up even though on our booking we had noted that we had a baby with us. We had to go back to reception and ask for a room on the ground floor. The next room we were given was right next to the main entrance into the building. The main entrance door to the block would not shut so a draft was coming underneath our door. We stopped the draft by putting towels down by the door. We had a baby in a cot which is close to the floor, having to put towels by the door to stop the draft is really not good enough. When initially checking in, we were asked a time we would like to have breakfast. We asked if we had to chose a time as with a baby we are never on time and didnt want to rush. We were told that we had to chose a time, so we did. The next morning we frantically rushed to get ready for our allocated breakfast time, only to find ourselves waiting in a long queue. At first we thought the queue was for our table and waited patiently. As we had to rush to make it down on time, our baby was still in his night clothes. We then realised the majority of people in the queue did not have their ticket with an allocated time on, and the Disneyland Staff were just letting them in for breakfast with no priority for the people queuing with a ticket. When we finally found a table we found it to be dirty, the milk machine was out of milk, there were only broken bits of bread in the bread basket and there were no glasses to get juice. This is unacceptable. We are trying to get our child used to a feeding time. We had to break our schedule to fit in with the Santa Fe rules, only to find out nobody was sticking to the rules anyway.All this time was wasted which we could have spent in the park. Our friends then went back to the room to get a shower while we finished eating and feeding our baby. On return to the room, they found the new key they were given didn't work, so they had to go back to reception to fix this problem. Once again, more time that was lost that could have been spent in the park. They had to queue for a considerable amount of time to get to the reception desk, only to then speak to an incredibly rude and ignorant manager. Our friends explained the problem about the key to him, and expressed that they were disappointed about loosing time in the park as they also had to queue for breakfast when other people were allowed to push in etc. The manager replied that there were problems at Santa Fe with regards to the breakfast, but they had tried numerous other ways of doing it and the way they were currently using worked best. He then went on to add that he had been to many other hotels throughout the world and that they all have problems. Our friends said that they were also frequent travellers and had not seen breakfast in such shambles as that! The manager went on to argue with our friends that he had been to more countries and and stayed in more hotels than they had!! We find this to be completely unprofessional. The manager tried to resolve the problem by promising that he would come back to the room and fix the key. He never did. The rest of our 2 day stay we had to share the key which was completely unreasonable.  When we finally got to the park we were having a lovely time until.. We had booked the 'Birthday Meet and Great' in the Lucky Nugget for our son's first birthday. Again, we wanted his day to be extra special and one to remember for all of us. I phoned twice and both times when I reseved a place I was asked for his age and name. Once again, we had to wait a considerable amount of time to even be let into the Lucky Nugget, in which time other guests had started gathering outside. When the doors eventually opened, we found the other guests to push in and bombard other guests. With regards to Health and Safety, this is a very dangerous situation.  When we arrived we were seated at a table and then we went to change our son's nappy. When we came back, the staff were handing out the birthday cakes. We found the waiters to be very rude. They literally plonked the cake down in front of us. Nobody said happy birthday to him. A card was also placed on the table which was blank. It didn't even his name writen on it.  Goofy, Pluto, Tigger and Tac came round to meet our son, of which he loved. Then we spotted Mickey, but he was going round every table so we thought he would come to us last as we were situated near the end. When Mickey finally got to the tables near us, we assumed he would then come to us. To our dismay we relised he was about to leave, so my partner went over to him and kindly asked if he could you come over to say happy birthday to our son and sign his card. Mickey's helper then very rudely and abruptly replied  no, we are going he has no more time . We were so incredibly disappointed and upset by this. Our son has a Disneyland Paris autograph book with pictures of him with everyone except Mickey. Later, the staff then brought around the surprise for the the birthday boy girl and missed our table, so I went to the bar and asked if our son could have his surprise. A staff member called Aissa then went to get one and gave it to our son. We quickly realised the surprise was not suitable for under 3's, so we asked them if he could have a different surprise suitable for his age group. Aissa then went to find another product and once again came back with another surprise that was not suitable for under 3's. Aissa told us they didn't have anything for under 3's which I found funny as we were in Disney which is aimed at children, and we had seen things suitable for his age group around the park. We found the lady we spoke to very abbupt and her attitude towards us appalling. I was concerned my son would pick up on her negative approach as they pick things up so quickly at his age. I informed her that we had paid for him to have a birthday cake, meet the characters and receive a birthday surprise and that he had not recieved his surprise. She rudely replied 'You didn't pay for him'. We had to pay 19 euros a head for the adults. What right does she have to talk to paying customer like that? She then tried to get around the situation by telling us the surprise was not included in the price, and then told us that he could have the surprise that was not suitable for under 3's for him. Items have warnings printed on them for a reason. If our son had choked on the gift that Disneyland Paris gave him that was not suitable for his age group, imagine the public interest and what would be printed in the newspapers. Luckily we did notice, but if Disneyland Paris is going around giving presents to other children and the parents are not so alert to this, it's an accident waiting to happen. I told her that I would like to speak to a manager about these issues, only to be told there were no mangers on site. Once again, if something was to happen in the Lucky Nugget and there was no manager around to handle the situation, imagine the interest of the public and newspapers. Something else waiting to happen really!Finally a supervisor came and spoke to us. He was very pleasant and understanding of our issues raised to him. He also told us that we could complain near the entance of the park and explained that he could not do much more than which we found to be resonable. So, why couldn't Aissa who gave him the unsuitable toy, or the manager at Santa Fe handled it the same? Why did they have an abusive, threatening and uncaring attitude towards us? We're paying customers, wanting a fantastic birthday for our son. We found the staff to be unreasonable with us and make our time at Disneyland Paris uncomfortable and stressful. So much time was wasted going back and forth which could have been spent in the park. We're disgusted that Disneyland Paris employ people with such poor customer service and unacceptable approach to customers to work around children and deal with children and families everyday on their special occasions. The time for his birthday party was runined and we payed 19euros a head *4 to be argueing a fair point with a staff member that was so unreasonable and rude which i feel is totaly wrong. We paid   636 for 2 nights in a draughty room which was not suitable for a child to sleep in a cot low to the floor. When we complained at City Hall the staff were very helpful, understanding and friendly. They totaly understood our point that we could not give this toy to our son and kindly gave him teddy which was very kind. Why couldn't that have been done earlier at the Lucky Nugget? They were also very sympathetic about our troubles at Santa Fe. They informed us to write to Disneyland Paris as this is not acceptable behaviour for staff at Disney. We are so angry and upset to think we paid all that money for our son's birthday and ended up treated in such a poor manner. Disneyland Paris is meant to be a family park and we didn't expect such low standards, rudeness and aggressiveness.  So, that was his first birthday. It was meant to be incredibly special. Instead, it was an incredible let down. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"

            "Translation error: J'ai été séduit par l'invitation à prendre le petit déjeuner tous les matins avec les personnages de Disney, mais il n'y avait aucun nombre donné du nombre de personnages Disney apparaîtrait au petit déjeuner. Ma famille, qui comprenait mon frère, sa femme et leur fille de 8 mois, moi-même et mon fils 2 1 2 ans sont arrivés à l'hôtel Disneyland (un hôtel classé quatre étoiles sur le site) et nous avons été perplexes quant à l'endroit où se trouvait le service de voiturier. Les instructions pour les voitures n'étaient pas Mark Cependant, lorsque nous avons compris où aller, nous avons été agréablement accueillis par le personnel de l'hôtel à la gare de voiturier et à la réception. Nous avons permis au service de cloche de prendre nos sacs et que la réceptionniste était assurée que nos sacs seraient à la hauteur de notre chambre sous peu. Alors que nous traversions l'hôtel rempli et un parfum de poudre de poudre, nous nous sommes dirigés vers l'ascenseur qui nous a emmenés au premier étage dans lequel notre chambre était située. Le décor était magnifique, mais lors de l'inspection de la pièce, la moisissure était notée dans les coins de la baignoire, aucun réfrigérateur n'était disponible pour les personnes avec des nourrissons qui avaient besoin de préparation ou de lait maternel stocké. La salle familiale que nous avons réservée était censée être légèrement plus grande et plus adaptée, eh bien, les familles avaient la même taille qu'une pièce ordinaire avec deux lit pleine grandeur dans une petite pièce. Nos bagages manquaient pendant une heure avant que nous appelions finalement la réception et atteignions quelqu'un qui a dit qu'ils feraient en sorte que nos sacs. À ce moment-là, nous avons finalement reçu nos sacs. Nous avons ensuite fait notre chemin vers le dîner ... c'est à ce moment-là que nous avons noté un avertissement. Les réservations de dîner sont simplement une exigence dans les restaurants pour le dîner. Le buffet des inventions était médiocre. Honnêtement, j'ai eu mieux au Hilton à Austin, TX. Nous nous sommes assis pour dîner et étions ravis de voir Goofy qui semblait se frayer un chemin autour de chaque table. Alors qu'il commençait à approcher notre table, il tourna le dos vers les enfants et commença à se diriger vers la cuisine du restaurant, laissant nos enfants dans le vent sans photo, autographe, pas même une tape sur la tête. Nous avons commencé à nous faire passer par plusieurs des personnages toute la nuit et non seulement nous avons eu le cœur brisé pour les enfants, mais aussi frustré. Nous avons demandé aux serveurs si les personnages sont apparus pour le petit déjeuner dans le même restaurant, car le site Web a dit que vous apprécieriez vos petits déjeuners chaque matin avec des personnages Disney, le serveur a déclaré que seuls deux personnages seraient à l'extérieur du restaurant pendant un certain temps. Le prix ne valait pas la nourriture ni l'expérience. J'ai payé 230 euros pour 3 adultes et 1 enfant pour avoir un dîner buffet que vous pourriez obtenir pour 16 dollars au total sur le Strip de Las Vegas. Je voulais vraiment que tout le monde mange jusqu'à ce qu'il soit complètement bourré, donc nous aurions la valeur de notre argent. Le petit-déjeuner le matin était meilleur que le dîner. Bien qu'un seul personnage se tiendrait devant le manteau de cheminée à des délais s'est formé pour que les gens ne soient pas repoussés. Les parcs eux-mêmes ne sont pas de taille et d'attractions comparables à ceux des parcs aux États-Unis. Nous avons commencé notre aventure un jour de pluie et en tant que tels, aucun personnage Disney n'était en vue. On nous a donné des billets FastPass que nous pouvions utiliser pour un seul trajet et n'étaient pas valides aux heures de pointe (à partir de 1300 1600). Certains travailleurs semblaient détester leur travail et traiter les invités du parc comme s'ils détestaient leur travail. Lorsque mon frère et moi sommes allés utiliser notre Fastpass à 1610, la dame de la ligne a déclaré que les billets ne pouvaient pas être utilisés parce que c'était passé 1600. Nous étions confus et fous. Walt Disney Studios était très petit et c'était en fait les enfants qui ont rencontré le plus de personnages. Il n'a fallu qu'environ 3 heures pour se promener dans le parc, voir les attractions et faire les manèges qui valaient la peine. Pour le déjeuner, nous avons décidé de faire notre chemin vers Planet Hollywood car nous avions besoin d'une cuisine américaine décente ... oui, ce n'était pas du tout ce que nous avons obtenu. La trempette aux épinards était dégoûtante, la sauce Alfredo n'avait aucun goût ni sel, la Penne, tout ce que ma belle-sœur a obtenue était si horrible qu'elle a craché sa première bouchée et l'a mis en gage sur mon pauvre frère. Mes fajitas étaient comestibles jusqu'à ce que je mette du quacamole dessus. Le quacamole avait un goût pourri. Et le service ... non seulement notre serveur était impoli envers nous dans le sens où il semblait toujours avoir eu de meilleures choses à faire quand il a pris notre commande, il n'a pas non plus apporté de l'eau que nous avons demandé 3 fois et a presque oublié la nourriture des bébés. De bien-être, ma famille et moi n'avons pas été impressionnés par l'hôtel, les parcs, le personnel ou les restaurants. Ce n'est pas une expérience que je recommanderais à moins que vous n'ayez vraiment beaucoup d'argent à perdre sur des aliments exposés à un prix et un service grossier et des personnages Disney insouciants et insouciants. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"

            "Translation error: I found several reviews appear to avoid the nitty gritty side of DLP:In some ways, I could justifiably call Disney land the persistence of the rat race on holiday, but then again that's often the way with Theme parks. One thing it was not   a relaxing family outing. I'd challenge anyone who suggests otherwise. If you enjoy organising your time, objectives, goals, memory within minutes of precision then disneyland is for you and perhaps your family. A touch of assertiveness and agression helps, just try not to be agressive to other people. I watched one parent hound a disney character and chase him until the guy gave in, but there was no anger. The French might be known to be arrogant but the only road rage I experienced was from a fellow Brit who simply could not give up his cutting you up habit whilst on holiday. You just need to speak to them with fair respect and do not expect them to automatically respond to your demands in English. After all I don't know many British people who would take well to Foreigners making continual demands in their native language. Just be fair. I lost my ticket for the photo of daughter and myself with Pooh; the woman in front was aggressively insisting that the photos shown were not of her daughter and despite the saleslady being polite and going through all the photos for over 15 minutes, the woman just walked off. How obnoxious. I asked politely and was treated very well and got my overpriced photo. Whatever happened to at least a little politeness and decorum?If you've been to Disneyland Paris before, you'll already know the rules, how to get around and what toexpect. If it's your first time, you are most likely to write off your first day and your children just may burst into tears unless you've brought them up to deal with theme parks and to be pushy and assertive from the outset. Having a pregnant wife and toddler in tow did not work for me, by the time we got anywhere the queues were unfeasibly unfeasible. Even walking up the Robinson Crusoe tree was a continual stream rather like london underground   seriously! you could not go back part way down, or pretend to be on a deserted island.If having a relaxing afternoon to sip tea, take in the view of a pleasant park and give the children free roam to play all all sorts of various paraphenalia, then visit the large gardens east or west ofParis; on a sunny day these are wonderful places to get away from the madness of modern day life, although you'll have to engage is some of that wonderful Parisien city driving and fight to find a parking space on popular days and weekends.This summer we found a place called 'Parc De Loisirs' in Normandie. It only cost us E30 for the whole family all day and it was a wonderfully semi relaxed warm summer's day family outing, hardly any queues and not overcrowded, included a brilliant water play area as well as fun for older children over many acres. It's not for teenagers but a complete contrast to Disneyland Paris which I would summarise as stressful mayhem. You can enjoy it but you must be willing to join in a 'fight for your right to party'; sit down and you'll miss your slot, just like the Stock Exchange.There's no doubt, its true that you can complete a fuller tour of Disneyland in one day, or two depending on energy levels and strict military precision.Take advantage over those who are making their first visit decide to arrive late, think that Disneyland is a place for a pleasant fun family outing, or simply are trying to get to grips with the layoutof the park and the various rides and activitesHence, if you have children of different ages and are more than one parent, family day it is not. Success lies in separation, unless you're all bursting with energy.Fastpass: concept is good and mathematically fair but as human nature appears to seek to milk every opportunity, rather like aggressive overtaking or undertaking at a roundabout, or queue jumping, manyolder kids can be seen hogging the fastpass machine a taking out anything up to 10 tickets at a time, on the same entrance ticket. This ought to be policed.Getting to see Pooh bear. The problem with Pooh is that most parents want their younger children to have a magical cuddle, or young children want to visit, or the odd female adult wishes to fulfilla dream of giving stinky Pooh a big hug. So Pooh is popular. The characters are only available between 10am until 12:30. If you are late in the queue, expect to wait over an hour while your littletoddler starts to get fed up after patently waiting for 45 minutes. And quite right they are too. So to avoid a long wait, go see pooh immediately you get in the park; after all your younger childwill not need fastpass tickets because they cannot go on those rides anyway   get into the queue as soon as you get into the park.As for children that are old enough to go on the main rides... head immediately out to get fast pass tickets for all the main rides (5). Then, before the queues develop, get on the rides that do not need fast pass tickets. Beware the temptation to go on a ride that just says 5 minutes waiting time, for once you have completed the ride, the fast passes are already set for the afternoon... Then if you want to have a tea with the disney characters, book it now by going all the way back to the entrance info desk, that is to get there before everyone else does. Try to book a time that slots in between or after your fastpass tickets.(The Peter Pan ride appeared to be for much younger children, for older kids and adults it's well... short. Lots of LED lights poking out of a miniature London skyline.)Now purchase an autograph book and pen from one of the kiosks.Beware, if you want to see the Lion King show   you must queue well before the time alloted to the distribution of tickets. For us, the time was 11 am, so expect to be at the distrbution point at thevery latest at 10:30 am   earlier, the better. Oh yes, you will queue until the tickets are distributed and then the queue will evaporate very quickly. But at least you'll have the tickets and you'll see allthose people who arrived at 11 am getting upset, even their children crying, or arguing with a member of staff.... watch out. Your only alternative is to buy a snack at the Videopolis and make your way to the sit down area inside where you can still see the show   as long as a seat or space is available, but it's not ideal. And by the way, do not pick your nose before the show starts as a camera zooms in on the crowd and displays the image on the two screens either side of the stage; amusing and embarrassing if you do get caught out (no, not me)!Ditto for the parade of disney characters, you must time your rides to ensure that you are already waiting on the edge of the parage route 30 45 minutes before it starts. Otherwise you will miss out. You could of course time your picnic to coincide and multitask, just like work, so as to not waste precious time sitting on a bench...Hopefully you now have visited several non fastpass rides without too much waiting and seen the lion king show. Meet up with the rest of your family for a packed lunch. Of course Disney states that you must leave the park to have a picnic, but at their exorbitant prices, its a complete rip off. And believe me, the food from Auchan is much better, that is if you are into french cheeses, brioche, authentic French patisserie and chocolate milk drinks   (do the same under the Eiffel Tower with a bottle of red wine).Try and catch some disney characters but note that they will wonder off after a few minutes either to relocate or take a toilet break.Spend the rest of the day going through all the 'walk through' adventures like the skull island, crusoe's tree or captain Nemo's.We received advice that rides would be easy to get on in the last half hour (19:30). Not true. However, cue up that one last time for about 45 minutes for your last ride, painful waste of time perhaps, but you'll get one last ride. An employee will ensure that the queue is terminated.In all of this madness, I never observed any drunken louts, spitting, or queue jumping as I have done in Thorpe park or Chessington.My family had an awful time on our first day. My toddler spent more time crying than having fun, decided to give up on waiting for Pooh and my 9 year old missed out on just about everything but a few rides that were not so popular. There was no magic, and quite frankly it was a total waste of money and time. I laughted at the queue for the haunted house   it was a labyrinth 'baaaah'. Being a sheep isn't for me, so I set this aside in my precision schedule for day two...Second day, I just went in with my 9 year old and put on my 'City Of London' driving attitude. My daughter was utterly tired at the end, but with my precision and timing we did the lot. Well almost, because we ended up wasting time when the Peter Pan ride broke down but still got on the ride in the end.It was partly my fault as I had not realised that the half terms for English and French school children overlapped completely, presumably at quieter times, life could be easier. However, I can only take my children out at school holiday times and I have now been told that DLP is crowded most of the time anyway.What I find amazing is that to take your family to Disneyland Paris on school holidays includes the usual UK price hike. Just before I went, I saw offers for   165 per person per night and that was 3* within the park; but there's no way I would want to stay within the park for more than two nights. Instead I hired a self catering gite (a lodge), 15 minutes from DLP for   250 including all the white goodsand heating costs (heating is a separate charge which is generally not levied in summer). Paris was only E27.50 and 30 minutes away, so we had 7 nights in the region of Paris, including the Eiffel tower, Montmatre, jardins de Luxembourg and Bois de Vincennes. With a few luxiuries, 7 days in Paris cost me under   800 including a relaxing break sitting in front of 'Le Consulat' in Montmatre, with two full days in DLP.Some interesting points:  the same pack of sweets as DLP was E2.90; in Auchan it was E1.13  Three hot chocolate drinks set me back E7.90, for the same price you can purchase a whole tin of luxury hot chocolate drink in Carrefour, which in the UK would be at least 4 times the price...  Pack lunch for the whole family, with treats, sweets and drinks cost me less than E10 each day, only a little more with a bottle of wine or Cremant  You must pay an additional E8 to park your car  My daughter's highlight was the Lion King show. Then Thunder mountain.  My highlight was the maze of tunnels and walkways inside and under Skull mountain, I stayed for ages.To summarise:If I believed in an afterlife, this would not be it.It was certinaly not the magical visit I had anticiapted for my 9 year old daughter, but it was fun once you acceptedthe crowds and the queuingThe potential for DLP was for us certinaly marred by the crowding and the struggle for resources and the price hiking  but still demand outstripped supplySome people can afford to spend   2k  for a week at DLP, but i'd rather take my family to the Belarics or Greece ona relaxing beach holiday. For us, holidays are supposed to be a least a little relaxing, not continual mayhem. Wethought that 2 days at DLP and 3 days milling around Paris was a good deal for under   800.Good luck on your visit if you go. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"

            "Translation error: Me and my young family think that Disneyland in Paris is fabulous! We   ve visited it twice now (Easter 2004 and August 2005) and we   ve had a trip to Disney World in Florida in between (Christmas New Year) and I couldn   t honestly say which is better. Sure, Disney World is bigger and it   s all in English but it   s so far away! In my experience both have their positives and negatives.People also say that the weather in Florida is better. Well, it certainly doesn   t get cold in Florida but it can get unbearably hot which can make the Disney experience miserable. I   d much rather have mild warm weather (like you get in Paris in the summer) than soaring temperatures when you   re trying to navigate round a busy theme park. The heat saps everyone   s energy and makes everyone irritable.People also say that Disneyland Paris is expensive but I   d say that   s true about Disney in whichever country you go to. Whether you   re talking about the cost of accommodation, food, snacks or gifts, Disney isn   t cheap but then the experience is second to none and nobody does a theme park like Disney!One thing really going for Orlando is that there is so much to do there (maybe too much?!) and each one of the 4 Disney Parks is fabulous. However, when it comes to Paris there is a major imbalance between the Disneyland Park and the Disney Studios. We struggle to find things to do at the Studios in Paris and if it wasn   t for the Stunt Car Show then it wouldn   t really be worth the visit. This is a massive disappointment because the Disney MGM Studios in Florida is fantastic and needs two days set aside to see everything.When you compare the Magic Kingdom in Florida against Disneyland in Paris then the obvious differences are the size and the language. But then the use of space in Disneyland is phenomenal with so much packed in and they also do try and cater for all languages (English, German, Spanish and French). You do have to remember that you are in Europe. We found that most of the signs were in French with English underneath; most of the staff speak pretty good English (much better than my French!) and that they make a good effort during the shows too. When we went to see the Legend of The Lion King it was entirely in English with French and German shows scheduled for other times during the day. The Winnie The Pooh show was in a mix of French & English and for Honey, I Shrunk The Audience you get a pair of headphones to put on and you can choose your language.Ok, enough of the comparisons because it   s fair to say that its    swings and roundabouts    when you try to compare the two side by side.Each time we   ve been to Disneyland in Paris we   ve stayed there for 4 nights and stayed at the fabulous Disneyland Hotel which sits pride of place right over the entrance to the Disneyland Park which means that you can be in Fantasyland one minute and back in your room 5 minutes later. I   ve written a separate review for the Disneyland Hotel in the appropriate section but I will stress that staying here has made our visits so much more enjoyable.The first thing that strikes you about any Disney Park is how clean it is. Then you might notice the fabulous attention to detail. There really is so much to gaze and marvel at and the flowerbeds, trees and grass are always pristine. Disney really does go out of its way to make the surroundings pleasant and safe.One word of advice (and this applies to everything Disney whether it   s meal times, retiring to bed or getting into the Parks)    THE EARLIER THE BETTER! The best time to be in the Disneyland Park is between opening time (usually 9:00am) and 11:00am, during this time you more or less have the park to yourself and can walk up to any ride and get on pretty much straight away. After 11:00am it does start to get busy. When it gets to noon you should be thinking about lunch because by 12:30 1:00pm everywhere will be packed.We managed to spend the equivalent of 2 full days in the Disneyland Park and we enjoyed everything that we did whether it was Star Tours, Big Thunder Mountain, Pirates of The Caribbean, Honey I Shrunk The Audience, Peter Pans Flight, It   s A Small World, Casey Jr     Dumbo   s Circus Train, Mad Hatters Tea Cups, Carousel, Adventure Island, Dumbo The Flying Elephant, Autopia (speedway), Alice   s Curios Labyrinth and the Pirates Beach.Yes you have to queue sometimes, annoying as it is, but if you do get in early then you can get so much more done before the hoards arrive. I think that every queue that we did encounter stayed moving and we never really became frustrated or fed up.Both of the parades were wonderful but then I   ve yet to see a duff Disney Parade! This Fantalusion Parade which was on at 10:30pm was especially good. Each float is wonderfully lit and this is enhanced by all the lights in the park being switched off as the parade starts. This parade was then followed by the Wishes Firework Display which was nothing short of spectacular and really does fill the sky.Our two kids are aged 7 and 2 and there is much to do here no matter what age you are. There is certainly as much for the little kids as there is for the big kids. Our 2 year old daughter had a whale of a time and still talks animatedly about what she did and saw at    The Disneyland   . We didn   t take our own buggy this time and instead we hired one which is easy to do and costs    6.50 a day. When you take it back you can ask for a receipt so that if you also visit the Studios on the same day (or vice versa) then you can get a stroller without having to pay twice. The buggies also have a useful foot plate on the back for slightly bigger kids to stand on.As I said earlier the Studios Park feels a bit empty when compared to the Disneyland Park. However, the redeeming features are the Stunt Car Show which is awesome (even if there is a bit too much talking in between the stunts), Aladdin   s Flying Carpets and the Studio Tram Tour (complete with Disaster Canyon). I think there   ll be more for us to do here when our kids are a bit older.All in all I cannot fault a trip to Disneyland in Paris especially if you stay at a Disney Hotel (I would definitely recommend the Disneyland Hotel!). There   s always something to do and marvel at, it   s clean and it   s safe. You will find yourself being swept away with it all because it   s truly magical, totally unique, utterly charming and your kids will love you for it! --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"

            "Translation error: My husband and I have just returned from Disneyland Paris where we stayed for 2 nights   3 days at Hotel Sante Fe. We are frequent visitors to Walt Disney World and so it was going to be difficult to NOT compare the two, especially as we had just returned from Disney World a week before. Before we begin, we are complete Disney freaks and even hold annual passes for Walt Disney World. If you stay at Disneyland Paris, from what we could see, there are no perks   no Extra Magic Hours etc. but you do get complimentary bus transportation to the parks or you can walk along a riverside path. It says it takes twenty minutes to walk but it only took us ten minutes to get to the parks and the Sante Fe was the furthest hotel away.The hotel was a disappointment but the parks contained all the main elements required for a Disney holiday. We did feel there was something missing   both in magic and atmosphere. We felt there was no real interaction from the cast members but in saying that, they were always polite and helpful and I am ashamed to say it but the rudest and most ignorant people, believe it or not, were the British. I could not believe it! Extremely rowdy, foul mouthed and cut in line plus there were teenagers running in packs unsupervised. Perhaps we picked a bad time even though it was during the week.To get to the Magic Kingdom, if you were walking from the Disney hotels apart from the Disneyland hotel, you had to walk through the Disney Village past the RER and TGV station. The Studios were to your left and the Magic Kingdom to the right walking straight under the Disneyland hotel. Most lands in the Magic Kingdom were closed until 10 am except for Discoveryland but most of the rides were down for renovations here, so there wasn't much to do. Although the Magic Kingdom was scheduled to open at 10 am, they let you through to Main Street USA at 9.30 am but entry to the lands was roped off until 10 am. Mickey Mouse arrived at the turnstiles about 9.25 am driving his toontown car which would be a complete no no in Orlando. This was a nice touch but he was positioned right in front of the turnstile causing a bottle neck. There was no opening ceremony.Town Square and Main Street USA are extremely pretty and looking up towards Belle's Castle, we had to kick ourselves to remind us we were in Paris and NOT Orlando. The castle is very, very pretty and amazingly pink and gold with square, green trees surrounding it. Once you got to the hub, you turned left into Frontierland (in Orlando, it is Adventureland) where there was Phantom Manor (scarier for kids than Orlando   recommend), Big Thunder (faster   recommend), the Mark Twain steamboat, Pocahontas' village and I think a petting farm. From here the path took you to Adventureland into Skull Cave, Hook's ship, Pirates of the Caribbean (back to front to that of Orlando but recommend) and Indiana Jones rollercoaster (on this occasion, it did not go backwards and we rode it three times in a row but enjoyed so recommend). Follow the path from PoC and it takes you to Fantasyland which appears to be more spread out than Orlando. All rides were walk ons and I know it drives everyone nuts but I loved It's a Small World   everything was just so much more fresher and cuter. Plus the maze is a nice touch beside Dumbo. Discoveryland contains Legend of the Lion King show, Star Tours (this is based in Disney MGM Studios, Orlando), Honey I Shrunk the Audience (this is based in Epcot), Autopia and Space Mountain. Unfortunately Space Mountain was closed for renovations. The Castle was a nice surprise   you take a staircase upstairs which tells the story of Aurore through stained glass windows and you can walk around the back of the castle via a balcony that overlooks Fantasyland. To get to the dragon in the dungeon, you can go down steps through the glass shop or down either side of the castle. This is very well done and very real. We found there were very few characters about the Magic Kingdom or perhaps we weren't looking out for them at the right time. We seen Fantillusion and thought this was very enjoyable and very well done. As for  getting your spot  to see it was quite a free for all. If you were at the front, buggies, kids and parents climbed over the top of you to get the other side and parents thought it was their gawd given right to shove their children in front of you, whether they were 6 or 16. Once was more than enough as it put us off to see the afternoon parade.We exited and went over to the Studios which was quite impressive from the outside. You had to go through Studio 1 to get to the rest of the park. Studio 1 was like a big warehouse containing a food court, shops and entertainment areas that included a band and film characters.The stunt show was amazing and I'm not surprised they're bringing it to Orlando   absolutely fantastic and WOW! Armageddon was okay but what made it was the cast member commentating at the pre show. He was hilarious and the best cast member we have seen playing out a role   someone who was enjoying the game. The backlot tour was okay, the highlights being C Canyon and the so called dragon in a London street spouting fire. We did not go to anything else on this occasion.We found the restrooms in several areas a bit on the dirty and smelly side, the food was very same y and it was hard to find a restaurant, cafe or snack wagon that was open BUT as it was low season, we accepted that this would happen.The Disney Village was okay. Planet Hollywood and the Rainforest Cafe only have a limited menu and is nothing compared to Orlando or London. King Ludwig's appeared to have more bratwurst than anything and if you loved steak you would have a ball. We love our food but even we found it difficult to get a variety apart from steak, burgers and sandwiches.It is very hard to get souvenirs that has Disneyland Paris stamped on it   unless you want tacky. Plus a lot of souvenirs are not exclusive to the park, you can also pick them up in the Disney Store in the Disney Village as well as the hotel shops. Again, very same y.We felt at the end that Disneyland Paris would suit people who have never experienced the Disney theme park and if you do intend to go, spend the money and stay at Sequoia Lodge or higher up. Hotel Sante Fe reminded me of a Butlins holiday camp. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"

            "Translation error: I will start off by saying that comments around the non Disney things are mostly negative. Not because I'm biased but b c they honestly were frustrating, unclean, or awful...sometimes all of the above. :( DLP itself was nice but NO comparsion to WDW in Orlando...didn't have the same feel, the same level of commitment from its staff, nor the same visitor enthusiasm (we only saw 3 other people besides us wearing Disney gear there). However, I must say that the Disney store itemsthey had were great, but I haven't seen the ones in Orlando for a yr now.EUROSTAR: We arrived by Eurostar (hi speed via the chunnel) from London's Waterloo station...nice ride. Filthy train, and we were in first class (stains all over the seats and floor; the bathroom lookedas if it had never been cleaned and the toilet paper was the equivalent of newspaper). They served a snack that consisted of a small can of OJ, ham cheese sandwich, croissant, yogurt and cereal bar. I know the company is struggling and now I know why. First class is NOT worth the $100 dollar upgrade.The Eurostar ends at Disneyland Paris. So, when you exit the station there's Disney Village, Disney Studios and Disneyland...very convenient. This is also the bus depot to all the hotels.HOLIDAY INN: From there we got on the bus to the Holiday Inn. Ok, why someone didn't remind me that we're going to Disney and the HI is NOT Disney I'll never know. For some reason it's rated higher than the Newport Bay club Sequoia on the Disney site (I'll never understand why...it is NOT a deluxe hotel by any stretch...the lobby alone is NOcomparison to the Disney hotel lobbies at DLP)...but between the rating and the $600 savings by booking directly via the HI inn website that's why we chose it. Believe me when I tell you that Iwould have paid more than $600 to avoid the buses at all costs and stay at a Disney hotel that's walking distance to the parks and train!! Not to mention that the hotel is 'cold' in its feel, extremely noisy, and much understaffed. We spent a great deal of time each day waiting in line to ask questions at the front desk. We often had to call several times to follow up on requests to housekeeping for iron requests. The rooms were on the small side for the money although the bathrooms were a decent size. Our room (Family Room) had a queen bed and a set of bunk beds along with a crib...it was crowded. I understand the 'Kid Suites' are a 2 room set up and much larger.BUSES: The bus transportation to Disney property but non Disney hotels was awful. The drivers never spoke a word, not even to tell you which hotel he just abruptly stopped at forcing you to become onewith the window or your neighbor, and heaven forbid he ever offered assistance. The drivers would fill the buses beyond capacity and then drive as if they were a Nascar racer. No, I'm not exaggerating. Not to mention the wait at the depot.SAD BUS EXAMPLE: Once my husband rode the bus alone to the Village to get some food and bring it back to the room (my son and I were in the room sick with some awful flu bug so he wanted to be in the room to take care of us and our daughter who didn't catch it...the HI REFUSED to let him takeaway the dinner food  although they let you do so with breakfast  which forced him to go to the Disney village). Upon returning he squeezed on the bus and was followed by a mother pushing her daughter in a wheelchair. My husband attempted to help, with baked potatoes in hand, no one else would assist the mother or my husband. The woman shouted to the driver 'you're supposed to lower the ramp!', he never did. Never said a word, nor did and of the other tourists (really, it was for the most part the most rude group of tourists I have ever been confined with). This forced the poor girl to crawl out of the chair and up into the bus. When it was time for the woman to get off a man next to my husband said, 'glad she's gone, she was grumpy'. Luckily the woman was w in earshot and returned to inform the man that her daughter has terminal cancer and that this was her last holiday. That about sums up all of our frustrating and sad bus experiences.PARKS: The parks are a bit smaller, but still very enjoyable. We were in no way park commandos, just out for a trip to see another part of Disney. I will offer this important show TIP...the Legend of the Lion King show always had a line of 1 2 hrs and sold out every time. Not wanting to wait in theline we went to lunch in the adjoining building, Hyperion Cafe. Low and behold they are the same building. Get your food, get a seat and watch the show while you eat!!!! You actually eat your meal a few rows above people that have just stood in line for 2 hrs and are likely tired and hungry by now! Note that they will not let you sit without your food.DISNEYLAND HOTEL: We stopped in the Disneyland hotel, which is actually part of the grand entrance to DLP. The hotel inside was beautiful and the staff so friendly. We wanted to cry when we walkedin...we should have followed our guts and changed hotels from the moment we arrived at the HI like we wanted to.DISNEYS NEWPORT BAY CLUB HOTEL: From there we walked over to the Newport Bay Club, which is thru the Disney Village. Again, we walked in here and felt 'home'! We thought we were back in Orlando. Again, tears. The staff was friendly. Of the staff we encountered there was some language barrier which surprised us, although most werestill helpful, except for the concierge. We had dinner at their more casual restaurant and it was wonderful. They have a fantastic kids buffet, which was so nice for them to have so many options.DISNEY VILLAGE: Much smaller than Downtown Disney in Orlando, much smaller. Mostly restaurants and counter service. We ate at the Chicago Steakhouse...great food, great atmosphere!PRIORITY SEATING: Of all the times we made reservations we had our pick of times, even at the last minute. I'm really not sure where everyone else was eating! The restaurants were EMPTY!!PARIS: We also took the RER train to Paris for a day and walked a lot...GREAT Disney store at the Champs Elsyees!!! Good ride, about 45 min.So, all in all a good trip, if we take out the HI and the buses. :) I would HIGHLY recommend staying at a Disney hotel (park passes are included in the reservation and I was told the hotels cannot bebooked w o including the passes). If you do not stay at a Disney hotel, I would next highly recommend staying at a hotel on the RER line...it was SO much easier to get on and off the train than it ever was to take the bus! I would skip the non Disney 'in the Magic' hotels. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"
