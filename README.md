# Our Science to Smiles

We are developing a Streamlit app to showcase all our high-end models. Stay tuned!

## Running the App with Docker

### Step 1: Clone or Download the Project
Download or clone the project repository to your local machine.

### Step 2: Build and Run the Docker Container
Ensure you have Docker installed, then navigate to the project directory and run:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This will build and start the container in detached mode.

### Step 3: Access the App
Once the container is running, open your browser and go to:

```
http://localhost:8501
```

### Step 4: Stopping the App
To stop the running container, use:

```bash
docker compose down
```
