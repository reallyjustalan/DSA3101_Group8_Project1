# Our Science to Smiles

We are developing a Streamlit app to showcase all our high-end models. Stay tuned!

It's so simple! To run the app,

## Step 1: Clone or Download the Project
Download or clone the project repository to your local machine.

## Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment
Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt and create a virtual environment:

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd path/to/project

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
```

## Step 3: Activate the Virtual Environment

**On Windows:**
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**On macOS/Linux:**
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

## Step 4: Install Dependencies
Install all required packages listed in the requirements.txt file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Step 5: Run the Streamlit App
Launch the Streamlit application:

```bash
streamlit run Hello.py
```

The application should automatically open in your default web browser. If not, the terminal will display a URL (typically http://localhost:8501) that you can open manually.

## Step 6: Stopping the App
To stop the Streamlit app, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where it's running.
