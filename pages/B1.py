    st.markdown("""
    To build an effective demand prediction model for attractions and services, we incorporated predictors that capture both **internal performance factors** and **external influences** like weather, public sentiment, and competition. Here's a breakdown of the key predictors used and why they were chosen:
    
    - **Predictor 1: Total Fatalities in Disney Theme Parks (By Year)**  
      While rare, high-profile incidents may influence public perception and visitor confidence. Including this accounts for sudden drops in demand due to safety concerns.

    - **Predictor 2: Weather (Rainy and Non-Rainy Days)**  
      Weather has a direct impact on outdoor attraction attendance. We included rainy-day proportions to capture fluctuations in demand due to unfavorable conditions.

    - **Predictor 3: Natural Disasters**  
      Events like hurricanes or storms could lead to operational shutdowns or deter visitor turnout. This variable captures the intensity of such disruptions.

    - **Predictor 4: Number of Public Holidays in Each Month**  
      More public holidays typically increase family outings and travel, which positively correlates with demand at theme parks.

    - **Predictor 5: Seasons (Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter)**  
      Seasonal effects help us capture peak tourism periods (e.g. summer holidays or spring breaks) vs. off-peak months.

    - **Predictor 6: Average Number of Night Shows (Disney Events) per Month and Year**  
      Night shows can boost visitor numbers by extending park hours and enhancing value for guests. This measures Disney‚Äôs in-park engagement strategy.

    - **Predictor 7: Market Competition (SeaWorld Orlando Visitor Numbers)**  
      As a nearby competitor, fluctuations in SeaWorld‚Äôs attendance may reflect shared market trends or competition for footfall, offering insights into external pressure on demand.

    - **Elastic Net Regression**

    - **Random Forest Regression**

    - Models were evaluated using:
        - **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**: Penalizes large prediction errors
        - **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**: Measures average absolute difference between predicted and true values

    From the performance plots above, we observe that the **Random Forest Regressor** consistently achieves the **lowest RMSE and MAE** across 5-fold cross-validation.

    This suggests that Random Forest outperforms other models not only by achieving lower prediction errors, but also by effectively capturing complex, nonlinear relationships between attraction demand and diverse external factors such as weather, events, and seasonality.

    **Final Choice:**  
    We conclude that the **Random Forest Regressor** is our most effective model and will be used to **predict the demand score** for each attraction.

    - A possible implication is that visitors **may still be drawn** to these rides despite bad weather.

    - **Limited Ground Truth on Demand:**  
      The demand score is a derived metric‚Äîbased on scaled wait times and total visitor count‚Äîbut may not fully reflect true customer intent or satisfaction. For example, high wait times may result from staffing issues rather than actual popularity.

      ‚û§ *To improve business accuracy, future models should incorporate direct demand signals such as ticket scans, ride entry counts, or mobile tracking data. These would better represent actual visitor choices and attraction popularity.*

      Random Forests, while highly accurate, operate as black-box models‚Äîmaking it difficult for non-technical stakeholders to understand or trust the predictions.
