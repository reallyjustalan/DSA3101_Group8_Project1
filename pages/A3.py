        ### **Suggested Solutions**
        
        1. Use process mining or sequence analysis to identify common guest journey paths.  
        2. Compare these patterns across segments to uncover opportunities for personalization and operational improvements.  
        
        ### **Solutions Implemented**
        
        1. **Sequence & Network Analysis**  
        - Identified frequent multi-attraction sequences (e.g., `7 ‚Üí 18`) and built a transition network using NetworkX to analyze guest flow.  
        - Segmented paths by attraction themes (e.g., Family, Thrill Rides) to compare movement patterns.  
        
        2. **Opportunity Zone Mapping**  
        - Combined sequence data with places of interest (POI) to highlight underutilized areas near high-traffic attractions using KDTree spatial analysis.  
        
        3. **Cost-Profit Analysis**  
        - Assessed travel cost (based on distance) between attractions/POIs.  
        - Evaluated the potential profit (based on attraction popularity) gained from reaching specific POIs, optimizing guest flow strategies.
