531138321,5,2017-09-01,United Kingdom,We visited for Mickey;s Not So Scary Halloween party this was the first night of the events scheduled. The park was very busy with really long ride lines. The main parade was good and the fire works excellent. Trick or treat staions were set up throughout the park. This is one of our favioute times to visit as the costumes are at their best with the addional theme. Worth the ticket price as you can visit both parks on the same day and enter from 3pm.  ,Disneyland_California
25004598,1,,United States,We arrived on 15th February 2009 and were due to go home on the afternoon of saturday 21st February. We hated it so much we left on the morning of Friday 20th as we had had enogh! The queues for the rides were absolutely enourmous most were 90 minutes wait. Having two young boys aged 5 and 10 and a 6 month baby we couldnt wait around for that long for a ride. Really rude people and really really expensive food. We had luch on the first day at pizza planet and spent   65 just on a salad 2 small pizzas and drinks. Dinner usually came to   100. We stayed at davy crockett ranch and it was filthy in the accomodation. We all caught sickness bugs whilst there.,Disneyland_Paris
155279085,5,2012-12-01,United States,Nothing really new in the Magic Kingdom from the previous year when we were here. Indiana Jones ride down most of the day so we didn't get to do that. Crowds were terrible later in the day. The Haunted Mansion is always a treat at holiday time as is the parade. Our favorite part of the park is New Orleans Square. Great atmosphere and food. ,Disneyland_California
3460644,1,,United States,"My husband and I recently returned from a long weekend in Paris. Since we were ahead of schedule, we thought we would catch some Euro Disney Magic! What we caught was very long lines, Fast Pass booths closed, several attractions closed, too many restaurants cafes and too few attractions. The staff was terrible at loading attraction cars   normally, you line up and they try to fill all the seats, right? 20% of the cars that went by were empty. Also, in six hours, we did not see ONE charachter! It was unbelievable considering that it was so busy. At best, it was lousy. If you are an American, you will most likely hate it. Another poster said the entrance was beautiful, but it went downhill FAST after that. I agree. Also, be careful if you take the RER out to Disney from Paris. Be sure your fare is correct before you arrive as you insert your RER ticket for entry into the Park. If your fare is short, you are locked out and you have to buy a  violators ticket  for 25 Euro. Europa Park in Germany is 10 X better.",Disneyland_Paris
594693531,5,2018-07-01,United States,"You will definitely want to plan out your day, and make the most of it by getting there early and if possible using an Extra Magic Hour to get some more time. Use Fastpass. We paid extra for MaxPass and for a small party (two of us), it was worth it but I can see where it can be cost prohibitive for larger parties.Be sure to allot enough time to park your car, go through security, and get into the park. Don't arrive at 8:45 and think you're getting in at 9:00   go 30 45 minutes earlier than when you want to be inside   even earlier on busier days.If you're staying at a Disney resort   or even a nearby hotel on Harbor Blvd. or Katella Ave.   consider taking a break. If your hotel is a bit further away (or you're a local and don't already know this), you can also visit the Disney hotel restaurants bars for a break   in addition to those in Downtown Disney.Make sure you pay attention to showtimes or special hours for certain attractions (i.e., the Sailing Ship Columbia), as they don't operate the entire time the park is open.",Disneyland_California
434171596,5,2016-11-01,United States,"We love love love the park. We have visited most of the Disney parks and this is our favorite. Make sure to grab a Dole Whip and the must do rides are, Indiana Jones, Pirates, and Splash Mountain. We found Matterhorn way to bumpy to enjoy.",Disneyland_California
281038718,3,2015-06-01,Singapore,"Went to Disneyland Park yesterday with my 7 year old. We had an amazing time but we were somewhat disappointed at least three rides were shut (space mountain, carousel and one other), there were no crowd control at the railway station, resulting in a lot of pushing and queue cutting which upset the people who spent 20 minutes queuing up before the train arrived.Some of the staffs were shouting at the patrons to get back in the queue etc, I feel that they should try to put it across nicely even though it may be for the patrons' own safety. Be prepared to wait at least 20 50 minutes for most rides and there is only 1 fast pass allowed at any one time. I've been to 3 Disneyland so far and this is the only one that we did not really enjoy. There are too many restaurants and too few rides for the kids....",Disneyland_Paris
339557119,5,2016-01-01,New Zealand,"What at amazing disneyland experience for the kids, to come here and have no queues...the longest we waited was 20 minutes for Its a Small World. Everything else was straight on. The xmas theme was great fun. I highly recommend this as an off season destination for a great family day out   if you dress warmly you won't even notice it's winter.",Disneyland_Paris
387623383,5,2016-06-01,United Kingdom,"Make the most of fast passes, always get one when you can. This place is truly amazing make sure to stay for the parade and fireworks at the end of the day. Honestly cannot say how amazing it is. Also breakfast at the plaza inn is a great way to meet characters without the queues and the food is amazing!",Disneyland_California
121300679,5,2011-11-01,Australia,"Plenty of rides that delight smaller kids.  A few  grown up  rides but not enough to go there for that reason.  Very clean park.  Fastpass access should always be purchased, very handy.",Disneyland_HongKong
379889384,5,2015-07-01,United States,"As with all things Disney in CA and Florida, Disneyland is just a fun, first class and varied amusement park.   Great for couples and families and groups of friends and Disney makes everything and everyone feel great!",Disneyland_California
195872800,5,2014-02-01,United Kingdom,"Visited Disneyland Paris in February 2014 with my 4 year old son and had a wonderful two days in the parks. We went over the school holidays so expected it to be a bit busy. The park is very clean and well presented and the staff were happy, friendly and willing to help. Could have done with a third day.(we know for next time)  Food and drink are expensive in the parks as expected.",Disneyland_Paris
156496430,3,2013-03-01,United Kingdom,"This was our 4th visit to Euro Disney and although we had a fantastic break it was definitely not what it used to be in that;People were smoking all over the park including while waiting in queues.Many rides with the same carriages were broken day after day causing longer queues than necessary.No ghosts on the back of the Haunted House Ride?Both times Screen Studio Tram Tours the commentary screens were not working.Music was not always working on the Aero Smith Roller Coaster. Pirates water ride and Crush ride both broke down while we were at the park.Very limited number of rides operating during the parks early opening hours.Lots of restaurants and food stalls were not open for the duration of our visit, therefore massive queues at the ones that were.Captain EO   awful   not a patch on the fantastic 'Honey I shrunk the kids' previously showing.Food unbelievably expensive.",Disneyland_Paris
111698723,5,2010-07-01,India,Difficult to cover both park in one day.Best to cover one part in one day and take combo passIt suitable for kids and family and one of best in california for family.Timing from Monring 6 to evenig 8pm and best time to trave in weekdays to avoid rush,Disneyland_California
271807920,5,2015-03-01,United States,This trip was special because my husband and I were celebrating my admittance to graduate school. The park was immaculate per usual. The wait times were not bad and we were even able to get a reservation at Blue Bayou. All the cast members we interacted with were wonderful. I can't wait to go back!,Disneyland_California
391603753,2,2016-06-01,Germany,It was my second time to Disneyland after having been there as a kid approximately 20 years ago. I went there with two friends and was really looking forward to relive the experience. But when we arrived there we realized that approx. 80% of the roller coaster rides were closed (only one roller coaster in the park opened). There was no transparent communication to this extensive maintenance work. On the map you could see that the attractions marked with a tiny Mickey Mouse head were due to maintenance at some point in time but you had to walk the whole way to see if they were closed today or not. Additionally it was end of June   so you didn't expect such a high proportion of attractions to be closed in the mid of summer!It is also valuable to mention that throughout the whole park there is a ban on selfie sticks  for security reasons  and the value for money in the restaurants is really poor.From my point of view it is a nice experience for children. For adults there are better parks in Europe.,Disneyland_Paris
240165727,5,2014-09-01,Canada,We had a wonderful time. Disneyland is truly the happiest place on earth. The shows were excellent. The staff are friendly and helpful.,Disneyland_California
261174469,5,2015-03-01,Australia,While this is our first Disney experience it was a good one to start with. My 8year old granddaughter was able to navigate her way around the park and go from ride to ride and world to world a few times throughout the day. She was also able to ride by herself when I did not want to go for for the 5th time in a row. We loved the the magic of the street parade as a fitting climax to a great day out.,Disneyland_HongKong
190463633,4,2014-01-01,United States,"It's been many years since we were there. It was much more crowded than I thought   but once we got the hang of fast pass, it worked well. It was the first time we ever visited when the park was in holiday theme. Disappointed by the Haunted Mansion holiday makeover but appreciated some of the new touches in Pirates (Captain Jack Sparrow made us appreciate how the animatronics has improved over the years.) ",Disneyland_California
82508536,3,,Australia,"It's one of those places I felt the need to visit just once in my lifetime. I did feel disappointed however. The price to get in for our family of 4 (for a 2 day hopper pass) was nearly $600. I did not feel the place justified such a high entry fee especially since there were still so many things you had to pay for once inside.Kids (8 & 10) were over it by the first day. We had to force them to come back for day 2 and we ended up leaving after just 4hrs, due to everyone being tired of walking and waiting in long queues. I heard other kids complaining to their parents and wanting to go back to their hotels.For a place that is supposed to be the happiest place on earth, there sure were a lot of miserable looking parents and kids walking around.The food available for purchase inside is another story   I wouldn't feed that kind of food to my dog! So unhealthy and disgusting. Don't eat at Pizza Port   ended up throwing it away.",Disneyland_California
191267562,5,2013-08-01,United States,"Disneyland will always bring out the inner child within me. Every visit I make, it's like going for the first time; it's always something fun and exciting, as well as something new happens everytime I go. A trip to Disneyland is not complete without riding Indiana Jones, Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, Space Mountain, and Splash Mountain; all other attractions are enjoyable, but the ones I've mentioned are my favorites. I tend to avoid Disneyland at peak times such as Spring and Summer breaks, ESPECIALLY during the holidays as it tends to get extremely crowded; crowded places means aggravating crowds. It's fun taking pictures with the characters, hitting the rides at Fantasyland, and I'd tend to ride It's a Small World when it's re decorated for the holidays more than once! Fantasmic! and the fireworks are a must see! I'd keep going there, and I doubt I'll ever get bored.",Disneyland_California
250313963,3,2015-01-01,United States,"Being from the US, it is easy to have in your mind, how all Disneylands are supposed to be. Well, drop the bar because the HK Disney is much smaller and therefore missing the key attractions we are used to. But the biggest thing missing is the food. Don't come here expecting to eat US food anywhere. Even the popcorn is different   honey mustard flavored. The chocolate dipped banana is packaged in bite sized pieces. I will say the mango Dole whip was the highlight. We ate on Main Street at the Coca Cola branded restaurant and it was meh. Nothing Coca Cola at all but the location was right for the night time light parade. We had a little extra show as there was a HKer yelling at a Mainland tourist for what appeared to be a cutting in line.Kids loved the Thunder Mountain like ride because there was a twist when the ride went backwards. Loved shopping in the Main Street store. The mugs are really cute and a few of the shirts were nice. Most of the shirts are garrish; very loud and overly detailed. Yuck.The train is cute with Mickey shaped windows and handlebars. There is a display in each train which has an enclosure with a bronze like character inside.Would I go again? Nope. Check on the bucket list. We got lucky on the timing. Went on a Friday early afternoon and stayed until closing at 830. Let the crowd go ahead otherwise you are backed up on the train landing.",Disneyland_HongKong
153574756,4,2013-02-01,United Kingdom,"Had a great visit with our 2 year old son. With him being into everything Disney he really enjoyed it. On every full day we were there we made sure we were in the park for 8 to take advantage of the 2 hours without members of the public. This made the queuing alot less painful. Unfortunately one of mornings we went in early 3 of the rides that were open(not all the rides open before 10) were broken leaving you little to choose from but overall its worth going in early to avoid the queues. Some rides were closed for our entirety of our stay which was quite frustrating as if the queuing gets too frustrating for a 2 year old all your really left with is a glorified shopping centre with quite a few restaurants chucked in. On the plus sides, even though the park was busy it never felt over run with people. The staff were on the whole happy and willing to help. The parades were really good and the lights and fireworks at the end of the day were brilliant. The Buzz Lightyear Ride was one of my sons favorites, whilst my wife liked the Peter Pan ride and Its Small World Ride (Beware the theme songs sticks in your head forever . The restaurants were really good and the food was really tasty & the shops, all though all very similar were not in my mind particulary overpriced as you wouldn`t expect them to be cheap. Overall, a great experience but possibly only if you don`t mind queuing.",Disneyland_Paris
157272437,4,2013-04-01,Indonesia,"I had been to the Disneyland Parks in California and Florida, so this one in Hong Kong had an air of  not in the right place  feels to it. This park definitely is much smaller than the ones in Annaheim and Orlando, and the number of rides are also limited. But true to Disneyland tradition, the Main Street is alive and busy with music, shops, snacks and cafes. It is a nice way to spend an afternoon in the open air, after days spent inside shopping malls!",Disneyland_HongKong
246686529,4,2014-08-01,United States,"Disneyland is a must go, at least once in your lifetime. This is the happiest place on earth, being an adult I still get a bit giddy when I get my picture taken with Mickey! The kids will ABSOLUTELY Love it...even your angsty teenager! The experience is worth the wait!",Disneyland_California
292783245,5,2015-07-01,United States,"If you have not been to Disneyland yet for the Diamond Celebration, you must go. The Paint the Night parade blew my mind with the extravagant floats and the bright colors that illuminate the entire park. The fireworks were the best that I have ever seen at Disneyland  I loved the movie clips and the corresponding fireworks. Not too be missed!!",Disneyland_California
122993372,4,2011-02-01,Indonesia,"I've been to Hong Kong Disneyland 3 times, all with my tour group. The last one was in September 2010. We spent a full day there while also stayed a night at the Disney Hollywood Hotel. This one Disneyland is probably the smallest among the other Disney parks around the world; you can enjoy all attractions just in one day. The cast members speak Mandarin and English, very nice. Best time to visit it is probably around Halloween, because beside having 2 parades, the temperature is nice too. I had lunch at the Royal Banquet Hall (ramen and teriyaki chicken wings), it was good and worth the money.",Disneyland_HongKong
295783819,4,2015-07-01,United Kingdom,Its Disney and its fantastic.   Have to say food and shops are very expensive and having paid a lot to go there the extras do add up and its only the children who miss out.,Disneyland_Paris
325766317,5,2015-11-01,United States,Park fills up about 11am. Becomes more empty after 9pm. Indiana Jones one of the few that is worth the wait. Bobsled coaster not so much.,Disneyland_California
368610237,5,2016-04-01,United States,Disneys magic is alive and well.  The Paint the Night parade a must see and of course the fireworks.  During the week lines are shorter.  Well worth it.,Disneyland_California
330527464,5,2015-12-01,United Kingdom,"I would like to say how safe I felt at Disney this last few days. After recent events I had my concerns but this was unfounded. There were armed soldiers at the entrance to the train station. The screening system that was in place consisted of all bags being scanned , people being searched and full body scans. Any hint of uncertainty and rides were closed down ( haunted mansion had a bag left ,closed down within minutes and fully checked) . We stayed at the Santa Fe and increased security was evident there as well. So well done Disney.",Disneyland_Paris
129268119,5,2012-03-01,Australia,"What an amazing place, we loved it! Is a great park for both kids and adults, so much to see and do.  Make sure you give yourself 3 or 4 days to visit as you will need it to really experience everything without being rushed.",Disneyland_California
271764843,5,2015-04-01,United Kingdom,We went to Disneyland Paris from Good Friday to Easter Monday with our two boys (3 and 6). We all had a brilliant time. The rides were excellent with fairly good wait times. It helped that we stayed in a Disney hotel and so had early access to the park. There was plenty to keep the whole family entertained. We particularly enjoyed the parade. We would definitely go back again.,Disneyland_Paris
154428410,4,2013-03-01,United States,Everyone tries to compare disneyland to disney world well....you can't! But that's ok. Disneyland is special for its history. The lands have unique experiences and rides that are different. We really enjoyed the French quarter. I just live disney and the California and venture park was just as cool. I love that its condense and you don't have to take a bus or monorail every where to enjoy yourself. The experience was magical and well worth the time to compare. You just can't go wrong in disney!,Disneyland_California
526000751,3,2017-09-01,United States,"Overall, I enjoyed my first visit to Disneyland. Luckily, I didn't have any children to bring (adults now) and would have dreaded bringing them due to the hordes of people children walking around, not to mention the awful wait times for children exhibits rides. I was surprised overwhelmed at the amount of souvenir shops. Every other building seemed to be for shopping. The themes throughout the park were fun to experience, but need to have more rides exhibits that enlighten one's knowledge of that theme. Overall, go have fun despite the looooong lines, the hordes of parents kids with strollers banging into your shins, and bring your credit card. Enjoy the parade, the exhibits, and the overall experience.",Disneyland_California
569545065,5,2018-03-01,United States,They have 2 parks if you can it   s better buy the tickets for both parks one is similar to Hollywood Studios in Orlando and the Other one its similar to Magic Kingdom. Both are magical and amazing,Disneyland_Paris
184212128,5,2013-11-01,United Kingdom,"We took our little girl who has disabilities for our first family holiday here. The staff , facilities and rides were amazing! Nothing was too much for them. The green card they gave us allowed us quicker entry and easier access to rides etc. The staff called out daughter by her name and always smiled and made a fuss! Two or three rides and restaurants don't allow push chairs but we could for our girl and wasn't a problem. The allocated areas for the parade and fireworks really helped also! I would especially like to thank Rupanzle, she spent ages with our little girl and later that day spotted here out during the parade and pointed to her and shouted  it's you!  And blow a kiss. Made my girl so happy and me and my wife nearly cry! Thank u!!!!! Can't wait to return!!! ",Disneyland_Paris
147272137,5,2012-12-01,Malaysia,"Get a 2 day pass, its well worth it as you can explore the park at a more leisurely pace. Very clean toilets and many eateries with a variety of food. Queueing time for the rides were 40 mins max and managed excellently.The LION KING show was AWESOME , we went twice for this. Dont miss it! Stitch Adventure was good too. Flights of fantasy parade was feast to the eyes!However was pretty disappointed that the Sleeping beauty castle was not lit up as magiacally as expected   looked more like a haunted castle by night ! And the fireworks are nothing to shout about.",Disneyland_HongKong
579457493,1,2018-05-01,United States,"If you enjoy the TSA screening process at airports, you'll love your visit. In fact, some items the TSA has no problems with won't pass Disney tests. Case in point. A rolled up 3 legged stool about 10 inches long (see pictures). Refused entry. Strollers the size of small cars   no problem. Seurity wouldn't allow storage in a locker, leaving the item outside the screening area, or even outside the front gate clear out by the street. Required me to personally remove the item from Disney property even after I told them to throw it away. Most Disney employees seem to go out of their way to make the guest experience great, but some of the security staff are unbelievably obnoxious and rude.",Disneyland_California
340664992,3,2015-12-01,Greece,"We visited at Christmastime 2015, was very crowded and 3 attractions broke down in the two days when we visited and almost all the attractions of the Wild West was closed. We had to queue for 45 minutes to 1 hour to each attraction. Considering the amount of money you pay as a family of 4 and although all in all the kids had a good time (but very very tiring with all the crowd) I don't think we will ever visit again.",Disneyland_Paris
257739559,5,2015-01-01,United States,"Disneyland is a time for my daughter and I to spend quality time together. We have annual passes and go as often as we can when she's in town. Whenever we go, we always try a different place to eat. It's a great place to get some exercising while doing lots of walking.",Disneyland_California
282292543,4,2014-07-01,United Kingdom,"Went here a while ago and forgot to put my review. I loved Disney Land.. the parades were amazing, good rides, good things to do throughout the day, get to have signatures off the characters which was cool:) Only negative is that the french are very rude (they push you out the way to get in front)",Disneyland_Paris
139436725,3,,United Kingdom,"Disney World far out does Disneyland in Customer Service, rides and atmosphere. We arrived during the Labor Day week end. On purchasing our tickets we were advised it included a 'early bird ' admission at 7am and that was good for either the Saturday or Sunday we duly arrived at 7am the Saturday to find the parks were closed until 9am due to a marathon run. It's fair to say it was annoying to both my group and others we encountered not because of the run just the lack of communication.On entering the park at 9am I spoke to a man at the gate who said he was the Manager,I told him of my   our frustration on not being aware and his reply 'I've known for months', well your staff certainly didn't. Fortunatly the rest of he crew were not as smug as the manager and a lady called Emily could teach her manager one or two things about being helpful and polite. ",Disneyland_California
246145542,5,2014-12-01,United States,We are used to Disney World in Florida so this one is small by comparison.  But very clean.  Everyone was friendly and there were many similarities..but fewer rides than I had expected.  Glad I experienced it.,Disneyland_Paris
255545635,4,2014-12-01,Malaysia,"Lots of people when i visited in December. Overall found that the Disneyland is too small compare to Disneyland in Paris. Good for family with children. If for adults, can opt for Ocean Park than this.",Disneyland_HongKong
502888086,5,2017-07-01,United Kingdom,This was my first visit to Disneyland and was amazed from the beginning. Walking up main street to see the castle in front was jaw dropping. I sent the whole timw I was there in complete ow and was amazed throughout. The queues were quite big for the more popular rides but didnt end up waiting too long as the staff had it under control well. The parade was really good and the fireworks were just amazing,Disneyland_Paris
215996297,4,2014-07-01,United States,We went on July 6th expecting it to be packed but were pleasantly surprised. No long lines for rides. It's still ridiculously expensive for a one day ticket. The more days you buy the better the deal. For six people it cost $576. A bit steep but everyone enjoyed the day. We caught the mid day parade. Fun to watch.,Disneyland_California
215235417,5,2014-07-01,United States,"Disneyland, for a post holiday weekend, was not too crowded. The longest lines were about 50 70 mins, and we figured out that if you were willing to ride on your own, that you could ride things much quicker. The big rides have single rider lines that tend to be on the short side. Overall, it was a good trip. However, there were more people after 600pm we noticed, and that is when we decided to head out.",Disneyland_California
528848881,4,2017-09-01,United States,We had free tickets for the park September is a great time to go during the week not as much crowds and we managed our time well with the fast pass and the wait lines yes some of the rides broke down but we were able to use our fast pass for another ride then the ride we want was back on line you have to manage your time and check what you really want to see Go early and head for the ride you want We enjoyed all the rides but this will be it unless we have grandchildren that want to go some day getting a little too old for roller coasters ,Disneyland_California
205422832,3,2014-04-01,Ireland,"Eurodisney does in theory what it says on the tin.. it has the various disney attractions and  looks  like disney. But it completely lacks charm or ability to draw you in   and the reason is the disinterest and often, plain rudeness of the staff. They act as if they could not care less whether you are having a good time or not. Obvious opportunities to help give information or smile or even not look fed up.. ! The whole place seems understaffed, and empty of atmosphere. There were some good friendly staff, but they were outnumbered. That that was our impression of the french staff at our hotel, in the station, at the airport. Any query.. minimal information was given, even though it was obvious that extra information would help enormously. For example, at the station, we asked about getting to the airport by TGV  it turned out that there wasn't any for another 3 hours. Even though the information staff knew we wanted to get to the airport, he information staff never mentioned that there were alternative  slow  trains. Or buses. Or taxis. It took three different visits to the information desks to about the next option as we figured them out for ourselves. It's as if the whole approach is to provide minimum information even though it's obvious that the wider request hasn't been dealt with. This is one of several examples. In our hotel, we were checked into a dirty room that hadn't been cleaned. When we went back to reception, we politely told them, but they treated us as if it was our fault, and certainly no trace of an apology. We had a good time because we were happy to be there, but certainly not because of any charm of the people. And don't get me started at the relentless Disney merchandising or bad food...",Disneyland_Paris
138991976,5,2012-08-01,United Kingdom,"Disney is Disney!  Fun, busy, tiring and unforgettable.  Parks open 8 midnight which you need to get round everything.  Can be done in a day but you probably won't get to do everything in peak season.",Disneyland_California
510322506,5,2017-08-01,United States,"I took my 11 year old for her 3rd time. She was pretty young the first two times and didn't remember much. I love that this park is doable. You don't need 6 days to see and do it all. We had one day. We got an 8 am start and in an hour and a half we had walked right on Pirates, Haunted Mansion, Jungle Cruise, Splash Mountain, and the Pooh ride. At Splash Mountain they even asked if we wanted to stay on and go again. We had our pictures taken with Mickey, Minnie, Goofy and Pluto in Toontown and didn't wait more than 5 minutes for any of those. By the time we made our way to Fantasy Land around 11:30 it was crowded and wait times were about 35 minutes. I know, 35 minutes isn't bad, but I was so spoiled by the morning. We didn't use any fast passes and totally feel like it was our luckiest day ever. We stayed for the parade and fireworks. I wouldn't miss the fireworks, but you won't miss much if you pass on the electrical parade. Too many people trying to see something at eye level. That was the only annoying part of the whole day. I will be back!",Disneyland_California
354929859,5,2015-04-01,Philippines,The kids have a blast all the time! Make sure you arrive before the park opens to get maximum FUN!!

Loved the Peter Pan ride and Buzz Lightyear. Meeting the characters in Cafe Mickey was brilliant for the kids. I loved all the different parts of the park. It looked amazing at night. I loved this place and can highly recommend to all! Would love to go again. Buying meal vouchers was a good move. ",Disneyland_Paris
5441704,5,,United Kingdom,"I've just been to DLRP for the fourth time, and we all had an amazing trip. The dates of our holiday were 25th June   1st July, which is high season (the queues were long). But with a whole week, we got everything done that we wanted to do, so my first tip is to make sure you allow yourself plenty of time to see everything.Secondly, the Fastpass system. You need to be pretty savvy to get the most out of this. Get to the park as early as you can (often its opened before the published time, especially during high season) and get all the Fastpasses you can immediately. Sometimes, it is possible to get multiple Fastpasses for the different attractions at over lapping times. Using this method, we did some of the busiest attractions (Big Thunder Mountain, Space Mountain, Buzz Lightyear's Lazer Blast, Star Tours) within a couple of hours. I stress again, be quick to get them  By 11am, the return time for Big Thunder Mountain was 18:00... and that often means you can't get another Fastpass until after that time!Eating out. Yes, its expensive, especially if you opt for table service restaurants. But some useful tips: the 'picnic' rule is not, in my experience, very well enforced. Most days on our holiday, we were literally taking in bags of food and nobody stopped us. Also, you do generally get what you pay for: for example, The Lucky Nugget in Frontierland costs 30Euros for adults, but you can eat all you want and the food is delicious, plus there are loads of characters and music while you eat. Book seats for all restaurants in advance to save having to wait for a table later on (you can do this in your Disney hotel or if you're staying off site at City Hall on Main Street).Finally, where to stay. My biggest tip for anybody thinking of going: stay in a Disney hotel. Its a little more expensive, but there are big benefits. Firstly, as the parks are very tiring its easy to walk back to your hotel for a freshen up before popping back (priceless in the summer when the main park is open until 11pm). You get free a shuttle service between your hotel and the parks, and the theming is brilliant. If you're on a budget, go to the Cheyenne and NOT the Santa Fe  Its only a few quid more but the rooms are bigger, the theming is fantastic and you get free Disney TV (you have to pay extra in Santa Fe!).I've been to Florida, and yes its an amazing place. I think many people are disappointed with Paris because they expect it to be the same thing  Its not. The Paris resort is not simply a small scale version of other DIsney resorts (when its finished, its going to be nearly as big as Florida anyway!); it has its own atmosphere and does things differently, but as long as you are prepared, make sure you've got plenty of time and read up on the resort as much as possible, I can't see how you could fail to have a fantastic time.",Disneyland_Paris
229381896,5,2013-12-01,United Kingdom,"As a major fan of Disney I have visited this park three times and am still yet to complete every aspect of the park. My first visit was during New Years. The park had its Christmas displays up, with a 100ft Christmas tree in the middle of Main Street, which made it feel so festive still! As we went at this time it did mean there were a great many people around and this did mean longer queue times but that was expected. We did meet some characters, got my autograph book signed by Belle and had a photo with Beast. The food at the park was reasonably priced and were well portioned. As we wanted to see the parade we did get to a spot along the route early, as there were so many people, so that we could get a 'front row seat' to it and sure enough we weren't disappointed, it was a fantastic show! As it was New Years there was to be a fireworks display at Sleeping Beauty's Castle. By the time we were ready to go see the fireworks Main Street had pretty much filled up so we went and stood up on the Main Street Station Platform which gave an amazing view and also offered more space than being on the crowded street below! The fireworks   AMAZING! It must have cost a packet to put on such a wonderful display and the end was just mind blowing, the sky filled with streams and streams of fireworks!! The second and third times I went were with my respective Primary school and High school, but the magic of the place had still not worn off. For both of these visits we went during what was still the French and English school term and so it meant there were very short queues for most things, with only slightly longer queues at things like Space Mountain and Big Thunder Mountain, but again these didn't take very long! Because of this we did manage to go on plenty of rides and make the most out of the money we paid to enter. During my High school visit all the rides were open apart from the Indiana Jones one. In the last couple of hours of the park being open, because there were so few people in the park, it meant that once we had got on a ride, in this case The Pirates of the Caribbean, it meant that once we'd gone round once we were allowed to stay on the ride and go round again and again without having to requeue. Souvenirs that were bought form the park were also good value, at the time I bought a mug and a beer glass to take home to parents which cost 7.90 euros and 4.50 euros. The Disney Village was nice too, the store was huge and there was so much to look at and to buy! Overall an amazing time was had all three times and if you are a Disney fan it is a must!",Disneyland_Paris

A small Disneyland with lesser rides compared to the other theme parks. But the program for the kids are packed plenty, such as the shows and parades. With a toddler, these are more than enough to be kept occupied the entire day, together with the rides.Having gone to the other theme parks, Disneyland really is one of the few that can create a magical experience for the kids. Strongly recommended for kids and family. If you   re going as a couple, it   ll still be fun, but you   ll run out of rides pretty quickly.",Disneyland_HongKong

Expect them; better still, plan to go in the off season. If you go at Christmas you'll be part of a mob and spend lots of time in line. Understand that a big part of Disneyland is soaking up the atmosphere and just appreciating the fact that you're there. Use FastPass wisely to cut some of the waiting time.It's really more fun without the kids! Parents, please know that your toddlers will not appreciate the park yet and may even be frightened by the life size characters. Don't take them till they're four or five.",Disneyland_California
121540033,4,2011-12-01,Singapore,"Excellent day out, went on a Sunday... plenty of rides to go on, don't expect a Florida size park or number of rides however the do have the classic Water ride and Space Mountain and Toy Story rides for the older children and plenty to do for the younger ones, the queues on the Sunday morning were not to bad max waiting time was 10 minutes each ride... If you want to see the fireworks they started at 9pm and lasted 10 minutes but was an excellent end to the day... try and get nearer the castle to see the fires works esp. if you want to take pictures or film it as the effects work better nearer.Best way to get there is on the MTR on arrival it is a 5 7 minute walk otherwise you drive and park but have to navigate the main roads, tolls and parking charges. They do offer a yearly pass so if you intend to go more than once keep this in mind, esp. if you think your have guests staying in the next 12 months will work out much cheaper for yourself.Enough eating places to cater for all tastes....

After days visiting museums and landmarks in Paris, it was nice to reset with a lil touch of fun and whimsey from the good old USA. The lines were manageable, and it was nice touch of the Disney experience, but don't expect it to compare to Disneyworld in Florida, I'd say more like Disneyland in California, small and quaint, just enough to get the feel of Disney in France.",Disneyland_Paris
76753310,4,,United States,Disneyland is still best of the breed but it is an expensive place. The entry price is quite expensive. We didn't buy tickets in advance and discovered that they had 'blocked out' the discount for locals and didn't offer discount for AAA membership at the park. Also we discovered that you have to pay extra to get into the adjacent and smaller Disney California Adventure which is right by the Disneyland entrance. A big disappointment is the additional costs. For example parking is $15 per day. Food and refreshments are very expensive (e.g. $18 for 2 hot dogs and two small cokes). The quality of meals on site sometimes leaves a lot to be desired   the $14 chicken lunch was like bad dorm food. Kids still love Disney. The staff are mostly very helpful and very friendly.,Disneyland_California

The ratatouille ride is by far one of my favourite rides as well as pirates of the Caribbean which I always have to go on.I have been coming to Disneyland Paris for over 10 years and it   s amazing to see it grow every year and see more and more changes and new characters and rides.The dreams firework show is so good and really nice to chill out to and watch at caseys.

If you are going as a couple we 'd recommend spending more time at California Adventure as it has more thrilling rides, but you have to do Disneyland too to let your inner child out. Also, if you are going as a couple we'd recommend taking a day or half day trip to Huntington Beach. It was a $30 one way trip with Uber (taxi will be higher). But the pier and beach are both great.

However, we found much more to do at Disneyland vs Disney Studies so allocate your time accordingly but in our case, Studios closed several hours before Disneyland.Rides are similar to the USA but there are fewer characters to be seen walking throughout the park.A few tips: make sure you have a printed copy of your tickets   otherwise you have to email their guest relations, wait in a line and have them print it for you. They offer free Wi Fi, which was a plus.

548560996,5,2017-12-01,United Kingdom,"This was the first time i have been back to Disneyland for 20 years and I still have fond memories when i first visited.This visit has just cemented some more great memories for me. Now visiting during non holiday season and during the weekday I can assume makes a massive difference. The longest queue times we had were either for seeing the disney pricness's and visitng Mickey, averaging between an hour and half to two hours. Other than that all the rides we went on we waited a maximum of about 40 mins or so.The parade is a lot of fun and that was even standing in the pouring rain. The Disney illumination for the 25th Anniversary is just amazing and makes want to dance and sing a long throughout, but do consider if you want to good view of the show to get to a good spot early. For us we got to a great spot an hour and quarter earlier, but it was worth the wait for the view we got (which was unobstructed by other people).Everyone is super nice and friendly and helpful, they all help make the Disney magic real.There are also many extra things on offer and one of these was the character breakfast at the Garden Plaze restaurant. For anyone who is thinking of booking this and wondering which day to book this for, I would advise to do it as early in your visit as possible, the first day if you can, this is especially for those that want pictures and collect the character autographs as there are characters dotted around the park which always have a decent sized queue, and if you are chasing the character autographs there is a possibility of having wasted time queuing for one when they would appear at your breakfast. As an example we had six characters at our breakfast which were, Pluto, Tigger, Eeyore, Daisy Duck, Scrooge Mcduck and Mickey. The breakfast is a buffet and has a huge variety of food from cooked english to continental and it was was all very nice.My only little issue is regarding the Disney Princess's. Now for those that stay in the Disney hotels you get to enter early into the park at 8.30am (general public are not admitted till 10am as of Dec 2017), at least for us when we were there it only gave you partial access to Fantasyland (also not all rides are open), this enables the eager beavers in the morning to rush to the princess's hut (amongst other things too) to queue early and see their princess much quicker, i think at most we waited about 15 mins to see them at this time. Speaking to the staff that work there they said they do not know who will be there from one day to the next, however i am sure they know who will be there in the morning as there is a notice board when you get there at 8.30am telling who is there and who will come in the afternoon and I can imagine the prep time it takes to get ready meaning that these actors that play these princess's will be there way before 8.30am. What would be nice is before you end up waking up super early and rushing off out of your hotel, to get to the park super early, it would be nice if in the morning (even perhaps via the app) to say which princess's were going to be present for the coming day at the hotels, as it's disappointing getting there and its a princess that you have already seen, and with not much open in the park at that time it means loitering around till 9.30am (when the other areas opened).Other than that, i had a fantastic time and i cannot wait to return!!!",Disneyland_Paris
648697273,5,2018-07-01,United Kingdom,"I was excited to return to Disneyland Paris after a 10 year gap! Stayed outside of Dsiney at the Best Western Au Trocadero. Got an uber to the coach bus stop and took the coach to the park. Had to be up quite early for this but it meant no time wasting! Was ALOT cheaper than staying on site. Loved the whole day, experienced the rides as the ques weren't extremely long, prices for souvenirs were mixed but I would say average for where you are. The coach was due to collect us at 9:30pm to return us to the bus stop however we wanted to watch the fireworks so we stayed til 11pm and got the final train just after midnight straight to Trocadero with no problems. I'd definitely recommend out of anything to stay and watch the fireworks, it was such a magical experience and there was light in kids and grown ups eyes. You don't feel any older than the small children because nobody judges, you're all there for the same reason. We visited in early July and it was extremely hot.. we didn't expect such beautiful weather but it made it a little difficult to sit and wait for the parade as you can imagine there isn't much shade sitting on the side of the road. We were there for the Saturday and we didn't get to finish the Magical Kingdom (only just) and we didn't even get to look at hollywood studios. Gutted but it just means i have to return!

189546969,3,2013-12-01,United Kingdom,"As a family we had had a couple of pretty taxing Christmases so we decided to go away together for the first time during the festive season! We were prepared for the cold, we were prepared for the wet but what we weren't prepared for was the general attitude of the staff. Morale seemed very low and it showed. A few people were incredibly helpful, but most of the staff seemed disinterested and not particularly engaged with their roles. The cleaning staff actually went on strike on the second day we were there, decorating the courtyard with toilet paper and banging on wheelie bins. They felt underpaid and unappreciated. The park Itself was super busy, with queues everywhere; rides, restaurants, shops and toilets. Everything took a long time. We opted to go full board which was a mistake. The food was appalling; overpriced, badly presented by an obviously overwhelmed kitchen staff. As a coeliac, I was constantly presented with a choice of two microwave ready meals, beef with olives or meatballs and rice at both lunch and dinner. I did try the meatballs, which was served rather charmingly in its microwavable tray with the film still on. I didn't try it again. I was advised not to eat anything else. although Annette's Diner did prepare me a meal they said was gluten free. My tummy was uncertain afterwards but that could be because of the fact I had eaten the chocolate chip cookies I was given for breakfast(!) for lunch as I couldn't eat anything else in the park. My husband and four children were sick to death of burgers by day 2. The fast pass machine broke on two occasions and two of the more popular rides developed  faults  and closed. It wasn't good. However given that my two teenage children (19 and 17) couldn't get a mobile phone signal we actually talked properly and were able to laugh about the situation we were in. The magic of Disney did help. and my younger children (10 and 7) very much enjoyed the atmosphere and shows. However having been to Disneyland Florida, Paris is very much the poor relation. Going to be writing to see if I can get the extra money I paid for full board refunded. I think that Disney need to realise that coeliacs cannot live on cookies and cake alone.....",Disneyland_Paris

Stitch Encounter  is also interesting with interaction between audiences and Stitch.  It's a Small World  is highly recommended if you feel tired or sweating under hot weather.

303131949,4,2015-08-01,United Kingdom,"I have just returned from DLP as a family of 4 ( 2 adults ,2 boys 6 & 4). It was extremely busy with it being august so i was prepared for long queues. We were staying in one of the disney hotels so had 2 free magic hours between 8 10 am before the park opened to the public. These hours only appeared to be beneficial if you wanted to meet the disney characters. Only the fantasy land area of the park seemed to be open and even then not all of the rides were open until 10am. Also a lot of the restaurants cafes were open either so if you wanted a drink you would struggle. Of course all of the shops are open!!The queues on the bigger or newer rides were quite lengthy from opening. In fact the disney studios park only opens at 9:30 (rides open at 10) and the queues for crushs coaster and ratatouille were already 1 hour long. At least ratatouille has a fast pass option although again not available until 10! And then gives you a return time of anywhere from 90 mins later. Crushs coaster does not benefit from a fast pass option which is a mistake but the childrens magic carpet ride next door does....makes no sense.The staff whilst friendly do not have the same level of efficiency that i saw in florida disney. There is usually one staff member counting people onto the rides, checking safety bars and running the ride. If there were more staff on each ride, it would be more efficient and the queues would shorten. There is a train that runs around the edge of the park and this is loaded up in the same way as a ride resulting in at least anhours wait at every station.Whilst some characters are around in the 2 magic hours i didn't see any other characters in either of the 2 parks for the 4 days that we were there.There is a parade at 5:30 every day. You must get there early to get a good spot,which is tricky as it is a short parade route, and be prepared to be shoved with the last minute crush of people. The fireworks are at 11pm when the park closes which is far too late for these adults let alone the children.Whilst we had a good time i really don't think i would rush back.",Disneyland_Paris

It was my daughters 4th Birthday whilst we were there so we experienced great character interaction due to that.The parades were so special especially as due to being there during the Christmas season there was snow created in the air which really gave it an air of magic. We watched the tree lighting in the evening again accompanied by 'snow'. After that we headed towards the castle for the Dreams show. It really is beautiful and very clever, just make sure you do it early on in your trip incase the weather is bad.Even though we didn't have great weather during our trip it really didn't spoil it at all. Many of the rides are under cover so the rain doesn't effect queuing and the enjoyment of the actual rides.There is so much to experience here you really do need more than a few days, so much so that we're already booked for our second trip later on this year.

629544504,5,2017-12-01,United States,This is such an amazing place to go with kids and family. Disneyland brings the kid out in everyone! I went last year for Christmas season and let me tell you!!

138270758,4,2012-08-01,United States,"Just visited Disneyland Paris for the second time in August 2012. There are two parks, Disneyland and Disney Studios. Disneyland is similar to Florida and California, but with some attractions not currently at the other parks, the Indiana Jones ride, for one, and a great pirate ship near Pirates of the Carribbean. Take a full day for this park, it can be crowded. As for Disney Studios, for us it does not offer a full days worth of activities. We spent about 2 hours there because we don't do roller coasters or Tower of Terror. You could probably spend a full day there if you like those kind of rides. They also have Disney Village like in Florida and California with loads of shopping and restaurants. Lots of fun for anyone who loves Disney.",Disneyland_Paris
242553421,4,,Canada,We love going to Disneyland but be prepared for long line waits! Unless you get there right when the park opens all the popular rides such as the Cars land area gets busy fast! Food is very expensive so come with lots of money! They have many places to eat but there are not many restaurants unless you go to one of their hotels.The park is lots of fun! There is no shortage on rides for all ages! They keep the park exceptionally clean which is amazing! Love the wonderful atmosphere and reAlly enjoyed the parades! If you can stick it out I highly recommend staying to watch the fireworks!!! They are incredible!!! I love coming here! We definitely will be back!,Disneyland_California
36140501,5,,Canada,"The best advice I received was to get there early. Cannot stress this enough. We had virtually no wait for any of the popular attractions when we went early. The fast pass is also very helpful. One day, it was 2:00 pm and we still wanted to ride the Grizzly RIver Run in CA. The fast pass return time was between 4:30   5:30 pm. This was perfect   we had reservations at the Rainforest Cafe at 5:30, so we went back to the hotel, cooled off in the pool, returned at about 4:45, rode the ride and went to dinner (WET). MY TWO FAVORITE RIDES at DL were Indiana Jones (SERIOUSLY, you CANNOT miss this!) and Splash mountain. We also did Pirates of the Carib, Star Tours and the Haunted Mansion (all very good). Did not do Small World (I had seen this many years ago, plus my 9 yr old son was not interested). If you have small kids, they'll love it. Would not do Autopia again. You ride around on these little cars but it is SO hard to press the gas pedal, I had to hold my leg down with my hand (and you cannot let up because someone will rear end you). A child would never be able to hold that gas pedal down the whole time. At CALIFORNIA ADVENTURE, you MUST do Soarin Over California. This ride is incredible and is like you are actually hand gliding! (I don't do coasters   this ride is different.) The Grizzly River Run was also awesome. Very nice to get that wet on a hot, hot day! Although the water in Paradise Pier was drained because they're building a new attraction, we went there because my husband wanted to ride the Maliboomer, the Twilight Zone Tower of Terror and California Screamin. He loved all three!  I WISH SOMEONE HAD TOLD US  NOTE: If you are staying at a hotel on Harbour Blvd near DL, use the 43 bus to go get your supplies (milk, snacks, liquor   for a cocktail after a loooong day at the Park). If you are on the side of the Camelot inn (or Best Western), take the 43 to Lincoln Ave. and get off. Turn right (east) and a block down, there is a CVS Pharmacy (liquor was A THIRD of what we paid at a liquor store close to DL) and there's also a VON's grocery. When you're done, go back to Harbour Blvd, cross the street, and catch the 43 coming back. The bus costs $1.50 per person each way. NOTES: Rainforest Cafe was a great (but noisy) place to eat. Awesome coladas and coconut shrimp! Take the 43 bus (in either direction) to a Carls Jr instead of eating at McDonalds. Their burgers are so much better!",Disneyland_California
519568934,5,2017-08-01,United Kingdom,"Staying at the Anaheim Majestic Garden Hotel meant we were only a couple of minutes by shuttle away from the park gates. What a magical place for our family of four. We really enjoyed this park far greater than the Adventure Land. It seemed to have a much nicer atmosphere, a far better variety of rides and attractions and some superb shops. The parade and fireworks were fantastic and all of the staff very helpful and professional, especially the litter pickers. Some must do rides are Matterhorn Bobsleds, Indiana Jones and The Pirates of the Caribbean. Star Tours was also great but so too was almost everything. Very clean, great security and a fabulous couple of days. The magic of 'Old Watt' lives on. A definite return for us in the future.",Disneyland_California

Over 3 euros for 250mls bottle of drink is disgusting, also none of the fountains were working so some people may not have had an option. Food is overprices and not great and as for the merchandise..... my son wanted to buy a Buzz Lightyear gun for 20 euros. It was something I expected to find in the poundshop (and even then I wouldn't have bought it as it looked like it would be broken before we even left the park!). My kids struggled to spend their money and instead we are going shopping back at home for something that they really want and is better quality.Rides: pirates of the Caribbean is great, also Buzz Lightyear laser blast, Peter Pan and Big Thunder mountain",Disneyland_Paris

The queue's for most rides weren't too long but if you have a fastpass that isn't a problem anyway.Although the Peter Pan ride did have technical difficulties on one of the days and we were waiting in the quite for around 50 minutes, this was on one of the particularly cold days which made it worse...luckily it's worth the wait.The Small World ride was closed on two of the days for maintenance, so on the day it did re open the queue's were ridiculously long all day, this put us off going on as all the other rides had ques that were less.The whole park really makes you feel child like and especially when you go into Sleeping Beauty's castle you really like you are in a fairy tale...which is the whole point.All in all, amazing. I cant wait to go back again!I have only 1 negative comment; some of the employee's of the park and I literally mean a very small portion of them   mostly they working in the shops, seemed lacking in customer service or even happiness, some were quite abrupt and did not seem to grasp that even they have an influence on the whole of people's experiences and it seemed like just a job to them.

The girls had a ball. And it was no where near a busy as Disney World.The only thing I recommend is   GET TO YOUR BUS EARLY ON DEPARTURE We were there with plenty of time, however we witnessed a couple of families get left behind & this would be the fast thing you would want after spending a full day at a theme park!

181793131,4,2013-10-01,India,Very good amusement park. They have only few rides but they have many shows which is awesome. You have to spend like 1 hr in que for each ride show which is frustrating so its better you go during weekdays like Mon Tue Wed will get less crowd.If you go during weekdays than 1 day is more than enough to cover all rides and shows but if you go during weekends or holidays than 1 day is not enough. Kids between 9 13 will have good time. Because this place is mainly for kids.

149529261,5,2012-12-01,United States,"We visted here on Christmas Day 2012. The park entrance was very impressive and easy to access. We have been to Disney parks in Florida, California and Hong Kong, and it is always a memorable experience. We enjoyed the attractions that were the same and also the ones that were somewhat different. Paris Disney has the best Space Mountain. Wow! The parade was great, but it did not have a holiday theme like the one in Florida. The evening Christmas show was very nice, and making it snow on Main Street just put everyone in a festive mood. The closing show with fireworks and animation on the castle was well worth staying until close. Other posts have commented on the food being expensive, but we thought it was average for what you would pay in other theme parks or at the hotels. We were able to ride and see everything we wanted with a combination of fast passes and just old fashioned standing in line. That is everything except the Peter Pan ride which always has the longest lines in any park we have ever visited.",Disneyland_Paris

I wish there was as I had a buggy that was stolen. There are buggy parks and that is where my buggy was stolen. So either rent a Disney buggy at    12 for the day or buy a bicycle lock. A 2 day pass in November is perfectly adequate but the were some rides that were out of action.,Disneyland_Paris

186840401,3,2013-12-01,United States,"It is, literally, painful for me to write this review, and only give Disneyland an average rating. I grew up going to Disneyland, my husband and I are HUGE Disney nerds! We visit Disneyland and Disney World once a year!We planned our annual Disneyland California Adventure trip for the Monday and Tuesday following Thanksgiving. We don't have kids, and we both have jobs that are generous with vacation time, so we're able to carefully plan our trips to Disney around times when there are low crowds. My husband has an app with a crowd predictor for ALL of the Disney parks, it's usually pretty right now. It was this time around as well, at least in the morning. In the afternoon, all of the annual passholders begin to arrive for the evening activities. At this point, the parks become so crowded, it's downright annoying. Working my way through the crowds made me feel like a fish swimming upstream. We are true fans, we take the time to do all the special tours. This time around we did the Walk In Walt's Footsteps Tour, guided by Summer Rose (who was amazing!). This tour was really worth the time and money, I would recommend it to anyone who loves the man behind the mouse. We still had a great trip, I was just so frustrated by the crowds. Not to mention how rude people become when they're all crammed into small spaces!So, I would recommend a visit to Disneyland... without kids... and make sure to bring your patience... and a major credit card.",Disneyland_California

I told them that I had a copy of the barcode that is on the back of my CityPASS and they still said that there was nothing that they could do. I had already used my CityPASS at DL and they had taken my photograph so I was really surprised at how unhelpful they were. I phone CityPASS the next day and because I had a photocopy of the barcode and proof of purchase from Costco CityPASS phoned all three places to let them know that I had lost my CityPASS. Disneyland then finally gave me my last day ticket. Universal Studio was excellent and just punched in the barcode and I was good to go. CityPASS was awesome and I would definitely use them again.

Celebrating our daughters 18th birthday this year we chose the hotel New York and were excited at the 25th anniversary free half board upgrades. There was very little information available on the half board options until we checked in, where you finally find out all the 'cans and cannots'. Got there to find our breakfast had to be taken at cafe Hyperion in the park   if we wanted breakfast in our own hotel it was over   50 a day supplement! Ok, so we head over the the cafe, voucher in hand, queue like cattle for half an hour, to be given this disgusting, rubbery 'omelette burger' and dry, stale croissants. So much for a 'free upgrade'. More like a stab in the back downgrade. And the half board dinner vouchers, well of course everywhere is fully booked (they didn't ask tell me to book restaurants when I spent half hour on the phone to them booking our holiday). So now we're here all we can get is fast food, which is ridiculously overpriced and pretty revolting, again   thanks for the free 'upgrade'. In order to convince one you are getting free special upgrade offers they've downgraded all the services so if you want the standard you've been used to in the park, you've got to pay more whilst you're here.

We already had tickets but the line to get in with tickets was about 15 minutes. It was so crowded that there were 2 3 hrs waits for most attractions. Fastpass was either not available or available during the 11pm 12am slot. There were three extremely rude Disney staff there. I had NEVER experienced that. One staff was yelling so loudly in the restroom the bday girl had to hold her ears and looked terrified. Three kiddos between the ages of 5 9 (one bday girl age 5) were unable to do more than 4 attractions in 10 hours. Navigating through the park was like driving on the 405 during bad traffic. It was not only crowded, it was like a can of sardines. Awful, never experienced this before and if there are many days like this now in the park, there will eventually be less customers. When the day is so overcrowded ....as this day was, admissions should be limited so some enjoyment can be had from families spending  magical  funds. No so. cal discount, no one day discounts. AWFUL.

235286655,4,2014-10-01,United States,"We booked a trip to Disneyland because my spouse had never been. Having grown up in SoCal, I went there several times as a kid, so I knew what to expect. However, at more than 50 years old now, I realized I didn't miss Disneyland all that much. Granted, it's fun! It's Disneyland! But we got our fill of everything PDQ. First of all, it was over 100 degrees in Anaheim that day; SoCal was in the grip of an October heat wave. Don't go when it's hot! Just don't! By the time we left, after 7 hours there, our brains were nearly cooked. We'd already bought hats (which were nice hats, of course) but not because we really wanted to...we HAD to. $20 per hat. Not that bad, really...I expected to pay more. And we'll keep the hats; we chose understated colors and minimal designs. But the heat was killer; I saw a couple of people laid out in the shade, at the edges of the walkways, with what looked like wet towels over their eyes. I was feeling woozy myself, especially after riding the Matterhorn. That ride jolted my old bones really good. It was just as fun as I remembered, though...only way more headache making.Our first ride of the day, Indiana Jones, got stuck halfway through. We sat there for 15 minutes, and during this time, they turned on all the lights. Talk about ruining the illusion! Like seeing the club that looks so cool and hip at night in broad daylight; tacky, grubby and sad. They offered us a second ride once we pulled back in to the landing pad and we took it. But it wasn't the same...we were definitely over it! We rode Splash Mountain, Pirates of the Caribbean and did the Haunted Mansion...that line was really long, and really hot. We heard not long after that all 3 of those rides had been shut down. Didn't hear why, though...maybe the heat was causing problems. But we felt good that we got our turn. We split a cheeseburger and fries, with a really good cupcake and got a soda, all for about $25. Not too bad, in my opinion. We worked really hard to avoid dishing out dollars for food there. We did splurge on some nice Disney sweats, to the tune of $40 a pair. But we wear sweats and they were nice, and it was a vacation, so we bought 'em. We did pretty well money wise, and actually came home with $150 of the $500 we budgeted. I was proud of us!Long story short, we made a memory and I took 300 pics. Literally. 300. They came out great. We had a good time til the last ride of the day: Star Tours. It's a Star Wars virtual space shuttle ride and by the end we were both feeling faint. I can proudly say we did Disney till we were nauseous! It was fun and memorable, especially if you've never been. But I don't see how families with more than 3 people can manage it, really.

313130114,3,2015-09-01,Saudi Arabia,Me and my wife and kids love Disneyland but for many reason this place lost its magic for the bellow reasons:1 People who work there are hardly smiling in fact some are rude like one guy in customer service for example also you can sense that there is no job satisfaction and it's a temporary job for a lot of them.2 it's dirty look and see the spider webs and you will know what I mean.3 toilets all dirty expect the alladin one.4  lack of characters to make the place lively.5 Ugly Princess's how can they inspire little girls.I visit Paris 7 times Orlando 3 LA 3 and once in a Disney cruise so for those who think Paris is nice go to the cruise or the US locations and experience the real thing.. 2  lack of care tires ,Disneyland_Paris
276594762,5,2015-05-01,United States,"I have no idea why people wait in line for 1 2 hours. Use the Fastpass system and you won't wait longer than 20 minutes to get on a ride. The park was pretty full on Friday, but the longest we waited in line was 30 minutes (early in the morning at Indiana Jones...without a Fastpass).Incredibly organized theme park. Love this place.",Disneyland_California
370003394,5,2016-04-01,Australia,"We had a four day pass which was perfect as it allowed us to rest in between. The park can easily be completed in a three day pass or two long days. However, this pass just gave us the added flexibility. There are two parks in Disneyland and we found the best way was to do one at a time. On a few occasions we did park hop to take advantage of our fast pass tickets. Food is expensive so bring your own if you can. A great place for hotdogs (try the Italian one) is on Hollywood Boulevard in California Adventure Park. There are quite a few thrill rides and more childish rides for the younger audiences. The Paint the Night Show is spectacular so is the fireworks. The park is clean, the staff are friendly and the rides are well put together. It is a must visit for all ages. Try to stay as close to the middle of the parks as possible as it will allow for the ease of access between the two and the least walking, as you will be doing a lot.",Disneyland_California

It was hard to find restrooms, and not enough employees inside the park to answer qustions or give directions, I was extremely disappointed that the steam train was not running, as that was the main reason we went there. Store merchandise was inadequate; we searched in vain for any merchandise featuring favorite charactors like Scrooge, Gyro, etc. On the positive side, they handled the overwhelming crowds very well, and with good security. Spectacular fireworks! If you can only visit one theme park in SoCal, go to Knott's Berry.",Disneyland_California

You may download their app for easier planning!",Disneyland_HongKong
120707850,5,2011-11-01,United States,"I've regularly been going to Disneyland since I was 6 years old and now am old enough to have grandchildren that age! I've always loved my visits and, although I've gone many, many times...every visit is unique. The best advice I can give is not to expect to do everything in one day, especially if you have young children with you. Pace yourselves and allow time to eat or just people watch for a bit.If you park in the  Mickey & Friends  parking structure, be sure to notice where you park! I've seen many guests leaving after a busy day, wandering around the structure, not even sure which level they on which they parked.I always recommend that guests have some sort of game plan. As you enter the park, take a schedule and brochure with map. Decide which rides attractions are  must do  and add others along the way. Attractions like Space Mountain, Indiana Jones, Splash Mountain, Haunted Mansion are usually crowded and you'll want to ride them early and or obtain Fast Passes. Make good use of Disney   s no cost Fast Pass system and try to have a FP in your possession all day evening. When the time has passed or you have used one, send a member of your party with all your passes tickets to go get them for something else. You can make priority seating reservations for the sit down table service dining establishments. This is also a time saver. You can call 714 781 DINE to make reservations ahead of time. Shopping is better done after you   ve gone to your must do attractions. Don   t plan on doing your Main Street shopping during the parades; there is too much chaos. If you want to watch the parade curbside, you   ll want to stake a claim on your spot ahead of time.If you have a baby or toddler, there is a changing station in almost every restroom. However, it is a treat to escape the commotion and pay a visit to the    Baby Care Station    on Main Street, next to the red Hot Dog Cart. There are even little toddler sized commodes! Little ones need to have a break in all the sensory overload.A nice break in the day can be to stop in at the Golden Horseshoe Saloon to grab something to eat and watch    Billy Hill & the Hillbillies.    It   s a fun show and a great place to regenerate. I've taken babies, teens, people in their 80s...they've all enjoyed the entertainment and the break in the busy day.Try to cover the park from one end to the other without back tracking if you can. It   s sometimes difficult if you   re using the FPs, but try to save steps if you can. Note: I   ve never been turned away with a FP that has run past the time window. You cannot go before the time stated, but you will certainly be allowed to go after.The main thing is to remember that you are making memories at the    Happiest Place on Earth.    Stay happy and have fun!",Disneyland_California
91552502,1,,Canada,"Just returned from Disney and it gets worse every time I go. I think the Disney company has lost sight of what the park was supposed to be: Fun. There is a sign at the end of Mainstreet USA that indicates the wait time for the  major  attractions. By shortly after lunch: space mountain: 120 min, pirates: 90 min, indiana jones: 100 min, etc... how is this fun? The shortest of these rides was a wait time of 70 min. We talked to a park official and he indicated 88000 for the day we attended. We rushed through the gates at 8am and ran straight to Indiana Jones and were told the ride is down come back later. We then ran to Space Mountain, lined up, got on the ride, our car started to move, lights came on, announcement: ride is malfunctioning and you are being evacuated; ride broken come back later. Back to Indiana Jones: still broken. As they day went on we got on some of the rides. The crowd grew. As the parade was about to start we were accosted by rude staff as we attempted to walk to Fantasyland and were told we need to be moving in a counter clockwise direction to walk there which amounted to around the whole park which didn't make any sense since we were about 50 yards from the castle? Way too full. If there is over an hour wait on EVERY major ride there is a problem. Not enough attractions? Too many people? Bad crowd control? Not pleasurable at all. Is this what Walt wanted?And I won't even start on $8.10 for a sandwich!",Disneyland_California
148398386,5,2012-12-01,Philippines,"First time to go to this place. The place was huge, amazingly huge, You'd go crazy of the stuff that you can do here. You can get a map in the entrance so you know where your going to go. Most of the rides that we went we're for kids since I had my sister's daughters with me. The graphics we're good and the over all production value for the Lilo and Stitch experience was amazing. The Lion King show was flamboyant with lots of beautiful colors on their costumes. We also had the great time going in the river at the Tarzan area, I forgot what it's called. The Winnie the Pooh had cute and cuddly story telling while riding the boat and there was also the It's a small world journey, that shows different countries and how their culture look like. I also got to enjoy the extreme rides at the Space Mountain. There was also the Tea Cup ride for the kids and the Autopia, where you drive like gocarts. There was also the Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters, which I also enjoyed, firing aliens and stuff, brought out the kid in me. Over all, it was great way to spend the time before the New Year comes.",Disneyland_HongKong
244765949,5,2014-12-01,United States,"I love Disneyland and have since I was a kid. My husband and I even honeymooned here over 37 years ago. Our latest trip was this month to be with some of our kids and grandkids and to see the park in it's holiday finest. I was able to experience some things in the park that I've never done before such as getting my first pair of ears and standing in line for the wristband to buy a hand pulled candy cane. Even with the rain it was worth it. I have yet to see a cast member be anything but professional and kind. Even with some were being berated because of parade traffic, not once did any cast member lose their cool. We had a great time and I'm trying to figure out when we can come visit the Mouse again! Due to knee surgery I was in a jazzy scooter on doctor's orders and not once did a cast member make me feel uncomfortable or that I was an inconvenience.",Disneyland_California

123097593,5,2012-01-01,Australia,"What a wonderful place. If you have kids or if you are just going with friends or family, you will have a great time. Make sure you get their early. Many hotels have shuttle buses that run so try stay at or near one that does. We stayed at the Courtyard Marriot which ended up only being $99 a night for two queen beds which we thought was very affordable compared to the others we looked at. It had a shuttle from the hotel next door which ran every 15 minutes and drop you right at the front entrance. Make sure you get their early, and use your  fast passes  as much as you can. Use them for popular rides such as space mountain because the line up time could be as long as 1 hour or more if you don't. We only had to wait 5 10 mins for Space mountain with our fast pass. we would book our fastpass ( you an only use one at a time ) then go on a shorter ride and come back to the popular one. We managed to do over a dozen rides in a reasonable amount of time with this system.Fun rides were Space Mountain, Indiana Jones Ride, Buzz Lightyear, Splash Mountain, Matterhorn and all the traditional ones for the little kids. Make sure you plan it well and you will really have a great time.",Disneyland_California
334941274,5,2015-12-01,Canada,"This was our second trip in the last three years to Disneyland. We travelled with a 5 and 7 year old in our immediate family, and had 4 other children between 2 and 10 in our party.We chose to stay at the Howard Johnson Anaheim because it was affordable and came highly recommended by friends.Planning   Do some pre planning. Don't go crazy, but a little research will save you time at the park, and help you to make the most of your time. I found the website Mouse Savers to be very helpful in planning our trip, and how to make the most of our time.The Disneyland App   Download the  Disneyland Park  App for your phone. Warning, there is no WiFi at Disneyland (I can't even imagine what that would cost them to set up a system that could handle that volume!), but the 3G, 4G, and LTE coverage seemed to be pretty good. The App will help you to find wait times for rides, current fast pass return times, when rides are closed, where characters are, nearest washrooms, restaurants, entertainment and more. We found that using the App really helped us to not be crossing all over the park only to find out that the ride we wanted had too long a line for the kids.Fast Passes   Use your fast passes effectively. You can only hold one active fast pass at a time, or have to wait 2 hours from the time you get one fast pass until you can get another one. So, you need to use a little logic in your planning. Rides like  Cars  and  Hyperspace Mountain  sell out of FastPasses early in the day, so go there right away and get your pass, you will need to wait two hours to get your next one, but early in the day there are shorter lines for other rides. Also   you only need one person from your party to scan all of your passes. Everyone else can enjoy another attraction. Fantasmic now has a FastPass option too. It's worth it to get the pass for the show so that you don't need to wait around for hours to get a reasonable viewing spot.Rider swap and single rider   I was surprised how many people didn't know about this. As a parent, you can ask for a rider swap pass when you enter the line up (fast pass or normal line) and then the other parent can go up the fast pass line with a kid any time that day. This is intended for parents with kids who don't want or are too small to ride the ride but have another child who does. We used this often because our kids had very different interests. On top of this, if you don't mind riding on your own, you can ride as a single rider on pretty much any ride. You just walk up the exit, and when there is a spare seat, they fit you in. Your whole party can do this. Great for rides that have a huge line up and you're not worried about sitting together. Food   The restaurant listing on the App does't have a menu option yet. If you look up the restaurants on the Disneyland webpage you can view the menus. Many of the  cafeteria style  restaurants have great meals, and are reasonably priced. I found a great salad at the food counter near the Submarines in Tomorrowland. We also enjoyed the meals at the Hungry Bear (near Splash Mountain). The cafe about mid way up main street on the right hand side as you enter the park is actually a Starbucks (if you need your fix)Treats   There are so many amazing treats to have at the park. We allowed our kids to choose one each day. That allowed us to have some fun, but set a reasonable limit. Some highlights: Dole Whip   By the Tiki Room, Garlic and Cheddar Bagel Twist   Food cart near Fantasy Faire (also has great coffee), Giant Dill Pickle   Various food carts around the park (Splash Mountain, Dumbo), Sundaes   at the  Creamery  on Main Street, Beignets   From the  Mint Julep Cafe  near the New Orleans Train station, Cafe Orleans (need a reservation) or we also enjoyed the ones from  Ralph Brennans Jazz Kitchen Express  in Downtown Disney (OMG), Turkey Leg   If you're feeling like a carnivore they are sold at many of the food carts.Magic Morning and General Morning Entry   Park hours are different at varying times of year. Be sure to look into that as you book your trip. Plan to be at the gate 30   45 minutes before it opens if you want to get in at opening. You need to clear security (a bag check) before you even get to the gate, and then the line up at the gate always seems to take 20 minutes or so. We missed most of our  Magic morning  because we foolishly thought that we would experience light traffic.Staff   the staff (Cast Members) are all there to ensure that you have an amazing experience. Don't be afraid to ask any one of them a question. They will help you. My wife lost her phone on the Matterhorn, and the Cast Member there had found it, and verified it was ours very carefully before disclosing she had it, and handing it over. Some very well trained individuals.Star Wars Land   Disneyland will be closing sections of the park to begin the construction of Star Wars Land in January 2016. Be aware, this may affect some rides, and access through the park. I can't wait to see this new land though!Park Hopper Passes   Although we had hopper passes, we found that we only crossed between parks one day. We had five days in the parks, so that may have helped with that fact. I would suggest that you consider your planning before shelling out the difference in pass price. We ordered one of our passes from Air Miles. Many rewards programs have this as a perk.Any way you look at it, this is the Happiest Place on Earth. Be sure to enjoy your trip. Take time to soak it all in. If you are travelling with little ones, know when to call it a day. Remember   you want them to think back on the trip in joy, not tears. I've heard of friends who used a Nanny service or the child care options at the Disney Resort Hotels, and were then able to return to the park with the adults. I would suggest that is a great idea.Have fun!",Disneyland_California
477107000,5,2017-04-01,United States,"This attraction was very popular years ago but was discontinued at Disneyland and moved over to Grand California Adventure Theme Park for several years.   I'm really not sure what the reason for this move was.   My guess would be financial but that's just my opinion.It wasn't until recently that they decided to reintroduce this famous attraction back where it originated by popular demand (I'm assuming).With that being said, we thought we would get a seating somewhere along the sidewalk along Main Street!    WRONG! The sidewalks were lined four deep with at least 10,000 people! Another testament to it's popularity!   I've actually seen this attraction at the Grand California Adventure Theme Park and  it never drew the crowds that were present this evening! As my pictures depict, it was about as crowded as  the Los Angeles freeway @ peak commute hours!    There was liberally nowhere to sit!   It was standing room only and about 4 5 does deep with spectators!The light show didn't disappoint and started at 8:30PM but didn't reach our end for another 20 minutes! The parade itself was everything I expected it to be and brought back fond memories of yesteryear.   I remembered a lot of the original floats and they were just as spectacular  way back when! In conclusion, this added attraction is well worth the price of admission, in my humble opinion.",Disneyland_California
133809401,5,2012-06-01,Australia,"Disneyland boasts the reputation for being the happiest place on Earth. We agree, it is hard not to get caught up in all the excitement. There is plenty to do all day, with rides, street parades by Disney characters, night shows, and fireworks. Do some research on the net before you go to learn how best to use the Fast Passes, it WILL save you lots of time in queues and help you get the most out of your day. Early in the day upon entry we found Disney Characters posing for photos with short queues. So go early and spend the day. Anaheim is also a beautiful place with plenty reasonable accommodation within easy walking distance to Disneyland.",Disneyland_California
64828616,3,,Brazil,"With our young family we went to Disneyland Paris in July 2008 and thoroughly enjoyed it. So we decided to return 10 12 May 2010. Not as good. This time too crowded and you feel ripped off when they close whole sections without informing in advance or give discounts in return. Closed were in Disneyland the Fantasy Land   s northeast corner and train station and in Walt Disney Studios the Studio Land Tram Tour and the supposedly new attractions in the northeast corner. Also the Crush   s Coaster attraction seemed to have serious technical flaws on 12 May 2010 and was stopped several times.As a consequence the crowds were much larger for the big attractions that were open, with waiting up to an hour the standard. The annoying fast pass system should be abandoned, because it does not seem fair that you have to wait in line so long and then you see people entering in 5 minutes through the fast pass route, even when you can make use of this scheme yourself (one ticket at a time).Crush   s Coaster: although the Nemo movie theme and minimum height of 1.07m give you the impression that this attraction is suitable for small children, the reality is that even for adults this is quite a rough ride. My boy of 7 came out crying and I was very nauseous. Twilight Zone Tower of Terror: this is not for the faint of heart and stomach. The very rapid elevator movements and stops made my stomach ache for hours afterwards and my children of 5 and 7 crying, although a minimum height of 1.02m seem to indicate suitable for children.Food at the two parks: although you pay over the top prices, your only option is a very limited choice of standard fast food items. At least one healthier simple buffet style restaurant at each park should not be too much to ask. Until then I recommend a backpack with food and drinks.Disney hotels: A big plus is their location next to the parks and the 08:00 10:00 exclusive Disneyland only park opening for hotel guests. Especially when rates are discounted a recommendation. If full rates, though, an expensive option. Hotels are huge and crowded with for breakfast, dinner, and transport long lines. A suggestion is to seriously increase the eating & transport capacity. The bus frequency between the official Disney hotels and the park entrances is too low, resulting in pushing and shoving of crowds once the bus arrives. The alternative    train    ride from the back of the hotels charges you expensively in a classic tourist scam, something that should be hotel courtesy.We decided that visiting Disneyland Paris twice is enough and we will not go backa third time.TIP: If you go to Disneyland Paris, combine this with city trips to Paris and or London using the next door train station. For Paris buy a day pass for a 30 min train ride to Paris centre and then the metro to any of the sights and events you like. A 6 8 hour period will already make this Paris city trip worthwhile. For 2 or more days go to London with the Eurostar TGV train. From Disneyland Paris it only takes you 2.5 hours to arrive in the centre of London, King   s Cross   St. Pancras station. For logistic convenience I recommend Premier Inn Hotel King   s Cross St. Pancras, a 5 min walk.",Disneyland_Paris

572023574,3,2018-04-01,United States,"Disneyland is always a great place for a family outing, and has always been e pensive for a family, but the prices are getting out of hand. We paid $135 for adults and $127 for small children. For our family, one day cost almost $1000 not including hotel and food. If one stayed several days to a week as some due it could easily cost more than a family vacation in many places around the world. Disney has tried to make upgrades to some of the rides. Also the Max pass which is $10 per day is worth the extra $10. You can get the pictures taken by the professional photographers downloaded to your app and phone. Also it makes waiting in line much easier with the fast pass. Fantastic was amazing as usual and we recommend getting there early to get the fast pass which are given by the Riverboat. The fireworks can also be seen there after the first showing which was helpful. Several of the rides had breakdowns during the day raising the question of needed maintenance due to the age of many of the rides. Although everyone had a very enjoyable experience, we will be going less often due to the increased prices. We used to go several times a year but it will now likely be 3 5 years before we try to go again. Disney is pricing itself out of the average family market.",Disneyland_California

The little stand at the end of main street has the best corn dogs! and I just love a place where you can buy pineapple spears to snack on. Fantasmic it the best show there is.

120612735,5,2011-11-01,United Kingdom,"We have visited Disneyland Paris several times before but this is my first review. I have to say that it has developed into a really magical experience for young and old alike. The Christmas lights and parade were top notch as we have all come to expect from Disney, there are also a few new rides since we were last there, crush's coaster, slinky dog and all the rides in the new Toy Story playground are excellent and we can't wait to take the granddaughters when they are old enough. Some of the rides are'nt available in Florida or California (we have visited both many times) and some are better because they are newer, for example  it's a small world . It's just a wonderful place to be and as always manages to make all your troubles disappear.

The parades and the illumination were the highlights of our trip. I was amazed by how great the characters were in portraying their roles. I wonder how long it took them to train how to smile and wave like real Disney prince and princesses. We were quite lucky because it was their 25 year anniversary so we got a really good deal. 25% off our hotel and it was half board as well. We are definitely visiting again,Disneyland_Paris
488324867,4,2016-08-01,Philippines,"Disneyland will definitely bring out the child in you. It is indeed the happiest place on earth...so many rides to take although most of the attractions are for kids but one will still have a good time in the park. Don't miss out the parade bec it is where all the characters go out and dance. Upon entrance at the park, make sure that you'll get a guide map so you'll know what  world  you want to explore. It is also where you will see the schedule of shows. For those who doesnt understand Chinese, fall in line on the attractions with English guides. The fireworks are to die for, I dont know but it gives us goosebumps...maybe bec it brings out childhood memories in us. When you get to the train going to Disneyland, make sure that your cameras are ready bec it's just going to be a short ride. Everything inside the train is all about Disneyland.",Disneyland_HongKong

167587741,5,2013-07-01,United States,"I've been to Disney World 5 times. This was my first time ever at Disneyland. We were not disappointed. We traveled with my 7 year old son, who has Autism, and my 4 year old daughter. The Guest Services personnel were so courteous and respectful when we got a Guest Assistance Card. Each cast member that we interacted with were extremely polite and helpful. My son tends to get over excited, and they were all just great about it. My daughter ran to all of the characters to get autographs. They were so kind, and seemed to really enjoy and understand the magnitude of their role for the memories of the kids that they were seeing. Alice, the Madhatter, Tiana (the parade  Royal Hall one) and the two Cinderellas that we came across were the best. I would definitely recommend this park to anyone. The parade was a bit short, but the princesses made my daughter day by blowing kisses at her.",Disneyland_Paris

592792758,2,2018-07-01,France,"My boys  8 and 11 years old  have been to Universal Studios in LA, Legoland in San Diego and Singapore but never Disneyland. We thought Disneyland Paris would be the best amusement park given the history and brand name. We were quite disappointed that many of the  Big Thrills  rides such as Pirates of the Caribbean, Phantom Manor, Twilight Zone Tower of Terror and RC racer were closed. There were 4  Big Thrills  rides at Disneyland and half of them were closed. The situation was the same with Walt Disney Studios. Disneyland Paris management didn't communicate that many of the  Big Thrill  rides were closed in the guide nor in the app. The app also did not communicate the correct wait time. We waited for over an hour plus for the Toy Solider Parachute Drop but the app said 15 minutes. The good things about the park were easy to get to via RER A and fast past. Anyways, Disneyland management could do better in communication and offering discounts when many of the rides were closed. If you are looking for  Big Thrills  rides try Universal Studios in Los Angeles. We had a great time there!",Disneyland_Paris

248119783,1,2014-12-01,Ireland,"Travelled here in December 2014 with my little girl, parents and two friends. It was supposed to be magical for my little girl. On our first night (we were there only a few hours!) we went for some food in the Plaza Gardens restaurant where you are directed to leave your buggy in the designated Area. When we came back after our meal we discovered my little girls buggy had been stolen!I Immediately reported this at county hall, to which staff informed me unfortunately it does happen. I was left to carry my little girl around the next day whenever she was tired or pay to rent a buggy even though we were the victims of crime. They offered no help and it was down to me to check in for updates or information. I walked to the police station to report the theft which took over 3 hours before I was dealt with, then onto Val de Europe where I had to purchase a new buggy. I also purchased a lock and whenever I had to leave the buggy I locked it to barriers. I would strongly recommend anyone travelling with a buggy to bring a lock and do the same. There are a lot of people doing it so you won't look out of place.The staff were horrendous and of no help at all other then telling me 'unfortunately this happens but we can't do anything to stop it' I am still waiting on a reply the past number of weeks having lodged a complaint So if you want to save yourself the hassle and keep your buggy safe, lock it! I wish I had this info before I travelled. I referred to these pages a lot before I left. We lost a whole day in the park due to no buggy,police station and shopping centre not to mention the extra cash spent on the buggy.",Disneyland_Paris

All of the attractions have a good eye for details, so even the trainride around the park is not just a tour around the park, but has some unique views that have been specifically designed for this ride. The Disney parade is a must see, although I feel for the people who have to dance in the blazing heat for a good hour in those suits.Certainly we were not disappointed, and it is easy to spend a great day here, but the high entrance fee and the terribly long queues for many attractions made me rate this four stars instead of five.",Disneyland_California
603965791,4,2018-07-01,United Kingdom,Only giving 4 stars this year as the rides kept breaking down. It happened to at least 4 of the main rides and it meant we missed out on out fastpasses. The park is still awesome but when some rides have been closed for over a year to refurbish them then they still break down its very annoying. With only limited time it's annoying to stand in a queue then be told once you are at the front thats its no longer working,Disneyland_Paris
164871397,5,2013-06-01,India,"Its the best experience you can have in France. Some people think rides are kiddish stuff. Not when you are sitting in them. Don't take the guided tour. The Metro trains go upto DisneyLand. Just look up the Metro map. If you are landing in Paris buy the pass which allows you to go Zone 5. cheaper than buying standlaone tickets. Plus the park is more than just rides. The thematic sets for each ride recreate the complete movie experience. You switch from being on the Armagedon to becoming Indiana Jones. The attention to detail is creating the rides is outstanding. From the queue areas to the exit. We also saw an outstanding parade at 7.00 pm and the most magnificent fireworks, musical fountains, light and sound show, animations on 10 Story high building all rolled into one at the magnificent closing ceremony at 11.00 pm. If you are not interested in the rides you still need to see this.We took the 63 Euro ticket for the 2 parks. Just about completed them. We had come at 12.20 pm. Try to reach earlier like say 10.30 pm if you are doing a 1 day trip from Paris. Is you are coming with kids then budget 2 days atleast.",Disneyland_Paris
514883875,4,2017-08-01,Philippines,"Definitely smaller than the one in Paris, the Hong Kong Disneyland also offers what the other Disneyland parks offers to its guests. Rides, shows, meet and greet session with Disney characters, a parade of Disney stars, and an impressive fire works display to cap off the day just to name a few. Just like the Hong Kong Ocean Park, I personally wish that the shows were done in English rather than Cantonese. Visitors of this place should prepare for long queues so if its a sunny day make sure that you also bring an umbrella with you aside from wearing comfortable shoes. It can also get quite hot in Hong Kong so also bring along extra water with you.",Disneyland_HongKong

397094485,4,2016-07-01,Australia,"We visited Disneyland as a big group and all of our various interests were met, The biggest challenge of Disneyland is getting through enough rides to feel satisfied but with the long lines this was a challenge. We only had a 1 day pass so could only achieve so much. It was a fun day with the Pirates of the Caribbean ride and Buzz Light year's ride being highlights for us. Unfortunately it was raining at parade time so we gave it a miss but if you want to see it you need to grab a spot early as the crowds were big. ",Disneyland_Paris
183685570,2,2013-10-01,United States,"Having been to Disney in California, Florida and Paris (previously) my family and I were really disappointed with our recent visit back to Disneyland Paris. The queuing was horrendous (but is something you have to deal with) aggravated further by several ride malfunctions which meant waiting an hour for nothing. The 'fast pass' queues took as long as the normal queues and to make the situation worse the 'no smoking' rule was not followed or enforced which resulted in standing next to several people smoking and not having anywhere to go! We also made the mistake of eating in a couple of the Disney restaurants (The Steakhouse and Blue Lagoon) and apart from being overpriced and already inclusive of the tip, regardless on how good or bad the service was their special dietary offering was appalling. My wife is a Coeliac suffer and was offered a choice of 3 'microwave' meals (brought out still in there boxes!) as an alternative. It was only after some heated conversation and accommodating staff that we eventually managed to get her something 'freshly' prepared. All in all I would urge anybody thinking of going to Disney to maybe postpone and save up for a visit to Orlando rather than waste their money going to Disneyland Paris.",Disneyland_Paris

618961957,5,2018-09-01,United Kingdom,"Went with wife for a 3 day break to the park. In the 3 days we had plenty of time to do all the rides and watch the fireworks twice at the end of two days before closing. We both love Disney so we enjoyed everything the park has to offer! Our favourite ride is the big thunder mountain roller coaster as it a good thrill roller coaster. My wife doesn't do ride which go upside down so Hyperspace mountain and Indiana Jones I rode by myself. I found queing as a single rider you did get on the ride quicker even if there wasn't a designated single rider. We was gutted that Phantom Manor was shut for construction, when we booked it the website said it would be open by the time of the visit but they extended the date :(.Food wise there is plenty of choice and different style returants e.g. counter or table service. We ate a few times at Casey's corner (hotdogs mainly) for both of us it usually came to roughly    25. We had half board meal plan so we had lunch dinner at Plaza Gardens, it gives a good range of grub ranging from salad, pizza, hot dogs, rice and many desserts. I believe without the meal plans it was around    35 per guest.The cost of everything it what you would expect in a Disney park, so all the gift shops down main street will be a little pricy some better than others. We brought 4 Mickey glass tumblers around    5 each. Later that day we brought two musical snowglobes around    40 each and these were the cheaper ones.We did find it irritating that some other guests didn't have similar etiquette with queing. Felt unfair waiting for a while then having guests push through but this is just a culture thing, didn't let this ruin our fab time. As with most Disney breaks it's important to pace yourself (I can admit I am terrible at this) because these parks are so overwhelming and fast paced it really takes it out of you. Thank you for having us and we will definitely be returning in the future again.",Disneyland_Paris

(15min for 'Its a small world' was very reasonable)Characters were all around but that did have lines. Luckily, I did book dinner at Cafe Mickey and we took ALOT of photos w some of the characters.

184949313,5,2013-11-01,United Kingdom,"After a disappointing holiday in summer to Egypt, I organised this small trip out. I went to Disneyland Paris with my wife, nephew and my son for his 3rd birthday. This was an amazing short break, the level of customer service all around the Disneyland parks, shops and hotel was of the top quality level. Each and every person we met were very nice and always willing to help, this is what you want from the staff. I could not believe how easy and simple the journey to Disneyland was from St Pancras (London). We came out straight I the the Disney complex and it was a 3 minutes on the shuttle ride to the Hotel which was brilliant. We stayed at the New Port Bay Hotel which was about 15mins walk away from the main parks, but still it was a nice walk because you can easily walk through the back of the hotel, along the lake and into the Disney Village in 7mins. The entire Disney complex is expensive so be prepared. On Our first night we watched the Christmas light go on both the Disney Castle and the Christmas Tree...which was a truly amazing start of our short stay, later that night we witnessed the Fire work display...the entire place came to life. We booked dinner at the Cafe Micky on my son's birthday and he loved it..we all loved it. All the characters came n sat with us for a bit and kept everyone well entertained. We got a birthday cake and people in the Cafe all joined in to sing birthday wishes to my son.At my hotel I was paying 10    for 1litre of milk for my son so you can imagine how much food price was all over the complex. Tips;There is a Esso petrol station near Santa Fe Hotel where you can buy various things for reasonable price, it's only cos I run out of cigarettes (causes harm to your lungs) that I managed to find that.Opposite the Hollywood Planet is the station so you grab few things from there too, also cheaper. Paris is only 40mins away so if you want a night out sight seeing, its easy to get there and back.",Disneyland_Paris

We also experienced the line jumpers   you think there are only a certain number of people in front of you and here come the rest of their 20 family members. Wish there would be a control of this. Husband also mentioned that they should only let a certain number of people in on any given day but then I guess they wouldn't make their money that way. Disappointing experience.",Disneyland_California
148489324,4,,Australia,"My family and I stayed at this resort for 2 nights. We were allocated an east wing room which had the swimming pool view. The pool size was great and had a giant slide but considering that our visit fell during winter season it was out of action, with this said there is an indoor heated pool which was of great size too ( next to a well  equipped gym  spa) . Being a family of 5, it was hard to book 1 room anywhere in Hongkong but the management replied positively about our concerns and allowed us to stay in one room for the duration of our stay. They even deep cleaned our room before occupying the room ( Thanks very much for this Disney Management ). The checked  in line was quite long and had a wait but next to reception there was a mini kids tv room to entertain the kids. And when we were looked after, they were very detailed. It is quite pricey to stay here but for an additional kids entertainment outside of the theme park was worth it. However, with the price of the accommodation, the StoryBook playroom one would think should be included as a bonus for the little ones, rather a fee of $100HKG is charged. The maze was a favorite and kept both kids and adults entertained. I highly recommended the Walt's Restaurant. Price is good and Accommodating to changes due to family food restrictions. Try the Enchanted Garden for breakfast where kids can be up close and have their photos taken with Mickey and friends. We were surprised that we were given a set of pictures as souvenirs together with key rings  with Mickey. This obviously a part of the package which was not noted when we booked so that was a beautiful surprise. ",Disneyland_HongKong

Having visited Disney in Florida 3 times I was surprised that this park was just as busy and the queues were even longer. The Disney atmosphere is in abundance but there was a lot of refurbishment going on and rides closed which is ashame when you have paid full price for a ticket. On the plus side it has lovely shops and Frontierland has a lovely atmosphere especially at night.

438867539,5,2016-11-01,United States,"We bought a two day park hopper pass since that was all the time we had to visit. If the time is there I think a three day may be less rushed but we did fine. Hopper is worth the difference in cost with parks so close to each other versus Disney World where you need to take more time to switch parks. Here it's a two minute walk from one entrance to the other. Park was busy but waits were never bad, most under 20 minutes. The Disney app is a must for getting your best use of time. The Christmas parade was great and worth getting a location 30 to 40 minutes before it starts but the fire works aren't worth getting in early with views from many areas being good. Disney is too expensive but they always deliver and make the adventure worth it. ",Disneyland_California
386680261,4,2016-06-01,United Kingdom,"Many of you will already have done your research on DLP and know what you're getting so here are a couple of thoughts on making the most of your time. My first thought is that if you are on a budget seriously consider going to the Disneyland Park only and give the Studio park a miss. We bought the pass of 3 days for 2. Spent a whole day in the Park and the next day went to the Studio park but were pretty much done in a few hours. It felt like a good portion of the park was closed for refurbishment and the shows had all mostly finished for the day and the characters weren't around very late in the day. The park itself closed at 7pm. This could be because we were outside of school holidays though. My other recommendation is to download the App, it's really handy for checking ride time and working out where you are and then also think very carefully before buying the photopass   it is very expensive!One thing I'd been pre warned about was queuing. Us Brits like a queue and to be honest the warnings were uneccessary. Everything was beautifully managed and there wasn't the free for all I'd been warned of   again perhaps because it was out of school holiday season.A final thought, it was really really lovely watching the characters with children. We queued for a good 45 minutes for Donald Duck but it was worth it. The characters really made each child family feel special. For shy children they tried to draw them out, for the more extrovert ones the character and park attendants were more playful. The photographers were lovely and got in on the act and I genuinely felt like they went the extra mile to give children and their families a memorable experience.",Disneyland_Paris

Everything was amazing and I can't think of anything bad to say about it. I went in January so there wasn't huge lines and the weather was fine (cold, but not freezing and it only drizzled rain a few times) but this would obviously be variable. In my opinion is was definitely worth braving the slightly poor weather to escape the massive crowds. Prices are high, but you know that is going to be the case, it's Disneyland. There are plenty of ways you can avoid spending, bring prepacked lunches and snacks, all the attractions are free, and if you are bringing kids just don't take them into any of the shops!",Disneyland_Paris

I was concerned that there wouldn't be anything to do while we waited for our time but there was always a smaller attraction to do while we waited. Do the smaller attractions as well. We made a late lunch reservation for the middle of the day. We chose Blue Bayou and it was great to sit down and recharge in a dark, quiet area with fewer children. The food was good (but expensive). One tip: free refills on soda! That might be the best deal in the park! Make sure and get a birthday button even for adults. It was great fun to be wished a happy birthday over and over.

You get the idea.If I can offer one word of advice for visiting any Disney park (We've been to both in North America): PLAN.There are so many good websites, other than just the Disney site, that can help you with planning and preparation for your trip to Disney. One of our favourites is DLR Prep School. Look it up; She does a fantastic job of taking a lot of the guess work out of making your trip the best it can be.From arrival at the park, to our departure late at night, we thoroughly enjoyed every single minute that we spent at the park. December 06 was my wife's Birthday and we made her wear the  It's My Birthday  button. Not only did the cast members wish her a happy birthday (nearly everytime one of them passed by us) but other visitors to the park were constantly wishing her a happy birthday, which made it feel extra special, that total strangers were willing to wish someone a happy birthday, even though it's so busy and there's so much to see, people here notice things like that.The weekends are naturally busy, but the staff on site does so much to make the lines work well, get people on to and off of the rides with as little fuss as possible and every single cast member that we ran into was truly in good spirits, even if they did seem tired from a long day of working with the public.Take your time, use the Fast Passes to your advantage, where ever possible, and be willing to wait in lines. Be friendly and chat with others in line and make new friends. It does happen.If you like Disney and you like Christmas, then you'll love Disney at Christmas time, as the decorations are literally everywhere, but very tastefully done. Look for the little embellishments that are scattered throughout the park; Disney really knows how to do this well and you'll have fun finding the little details that have been put up around the parks.",Disneyland_California
207683189,5,2014-03-01,Italy,"Been there twice, last time was with my little daughter and it was amazing to see her eyes full of joy and her screaming because of happiness when she saw her heroes and princesses! The entrance tickets are not cheap and for sure it's cheaper if you buy on line in advance. You have all family services and facilities you might need, everything is included in the entrance tickets except food and of course all souvenirs ( loads of shops inside). Little shows during the day are very entertaining, but nothing compared to the final parade! All the Disney stars walking and dancing along Main Street, it's such a great show! The best part for sure! Unfortunately we were there in mid march during the week and probably that's the reason why most restaurants were closed and daily activities and shows were less in number. Despite this, I am looking forward to visiting it again soon!",Disneyland_Paris
278427499,5,2015-06-01,United Kingdom,"Just got back from our second trip to Disneyland. It's an incredible place. So much to do. The weather was amazing it was around 32 degrees for all 5 days we were there. Plenty of choices for places to eat. We tended to pay for a proper meal around lunchtime and then just go to the McDonald's in Disney village in the evening. A lot of the places do special meal deals too for example casey's diner do the hotdog, chips, brownie and drink for around 12 euros which isn't too bad. A good all you can eat place which is quite cheap is buzz light years pizza planet which is    17.99 with unlimited drinks too. The queues for rides weren't too bad. The longest was crushers coaster which was about a hour. We went on pirates of the Caribbean about 10 times whilst we were there. We never had to wait more than 5 minutes and got straight on at times. The first time we went on ratatouille we went as a group and queued about 40 minutes but after that we always went on single riders and again got on straight away with no queue at all. It's just an incredible all round place. So much magic and happiness. Can't wait to return.",Disneyland_Paris
476884269,5,2017-04-01,United States,"We have been to Disney World in Orlando many times and still found Disneyland very enjoyable. The last time I had been at Disneyland they still used the lettered tickets   so let's just say it had been awhile. The staff is exceptional, we were able to get food quickly and lines were manageable. Being spring break the park was VERY crowded (even on a Tuesday)   so navigating our way through the park felt very congested. We spent one day here and found that to be a good amount of time. We probably could have used another half day. With that said, I also pre plan our Disney days by visiting Disney's website prior to our trip to make a wish list of the shows and attractions we want to see and do. Once in the park we grab a map and highlight (bring one with you to the park) the numbers of the attractions we want to be sure to include in our day. This saves a lot of time chasing around the park and wondering if you forgot something. As other reviewers suggest   you have to maximize the Fast Pass program. The one ride that I wish that they had a FP for and don't is Peter Pan. It's always a long wait. After the 10:30 fireworks we were able to get on it (waited 35 minutes). If you also like this ride I would recommend going on it first thing (after getting your map and for first FP tickets) or during the afternoon parade. Note that a number of rides in Fantasyland close (temporarily) during the electric light parade and open after the last fireworks. I also found that the Disney app (see their website for the specific one) was very helpful when looking for characters, ride wait times, finding bathrooms, looking at menus etc.   and it's free. We'll go back some day   loved it!",Disneyland_California

241579543,4,2014-11-01,Singapore,"Well it's either I've not been watching disney cartoons or the theme park is using non Disney characters. Either way, the experience was great as there were a mixture of rides for young and also for older kids. Mystery manor was best for me not for the exciting ride but the video presentation throughout the ride was good and almost (a little lower than almost rather) real. Having said this, it might be not so great for not so young kids as the rides suitable for them are not many and the rest might feel a little boring to them. I also find this Disney a little small compared to the one in paris(I've only been to two Disney, this being the second one). A single day is sufficient if you are just covering the rides. The parades and fireworks finale were great, as usual. The restaurant food don't appeal to me so I was glad we brought our own food. The trip there was easy as there is a mtr station serving Disney. The train and it's interior were themed. So the excitement starts even from the arriving journey. By the way, you can buy the entrance tickets from circle k convenient stores and the travellex at k11 shopping centre. I recommend circle k as they are cheaper but you need an additional step to exchange the issued voucher for real tickets at Disney entrance. Great experience although I think some of the characters are non Disney.",Disneyland_HongKong

While we expected to find lines at rides we didn't expect to have to wait hours for a ride that lasted less that ten minutes! We spent hard earned money to take our youngest grandson on a trip that we wanted to be special for a grandson who has already overcome health obstacles in his young life. This was a trip I would not recommend to anyone. The so called  fast pass  system is only  fast  in the short times that they are available. Finding the location is like looking for a needle in a haystack! Do not eat the food found at the park  not only is it expensive it is terrible. Disney has always been known for their excellent service. This was not true during this visit. The Disney photographers did not even give us a chance to take pictures of the places we wanted to take  we were moved out of the way rudely. The final straw came when the Pirates of the Caribbean broke down. We were stuck for over 20 minutes! Do NOT visit during any holiday weekend!

I want to make my perspective clear  we have held annual passports 3 times, once as a couple, and twice for our entire family of eight. We have had many wonderful experiences here! It is still clean as a whistle, the rides are fun, the employees friendly. The food is great in some venues, so so in others. So, why 4 stars? The price of admission has continued to skyrocket, and what you receive for what you pay has become less and less. One of our daughters, a season pass holder until a month ago, has not renewed because the price went up $250 AND they took away her parking pass and added 2 restricted weeks. It has become incredibly difficult for a family to afford admission at over $100 for one day in one park plus $18 for parking. Food prices continue to rise as well, it is crowded, even in late Oct. on a Tuesday, etc. etc. The shops lost their uniqueness years ago  it used to be that the things you bought in one area were not in another  they were individual to that land. Not anymore. It has become very obvious that Disneyland is now all about how much money they can make  at what price will people stop coming. The great entertainers are gone  no more Billy Hill, hardly any live entertainment. Sad. Very sad. That said, shoot me, I still love the place.",Disneyland_California

I love Disney, and came to DLP a few years ago as a surprise birthday present   I just can't believe how run down it's become in such a short space of time. At many times the big rides were shut, with little information given about why. These included Big Thunder Mountain, Tower of Terror, Space Mountain. The staff seemed very bored and nobody went out of their way to be helpful or friendly. There were mice in McDonalds and in Billy Bob's resturant, and staff's attitude was very blase and said  Yes, it's Mickey and Minnie'. They didn't think it was a big deal to have mice running around where people were eating. Was told by a member of staff out of hours that the park is overun with vermin and if Health and Safety got in they would shut it down. Nice! I went as a lecturer supervising students so didn't pay for a ticket, if I did I would be demanding my money back.

365108529,3,2016-04-01,Australia,"Spent 4 nights at Disneyland Paris with my boyfriend and had high hopes after visiting the Anaheim & Florida parks a couple of times. Unfortunately while Disneyland Paris had all the makings of a Disney experience there were some gaps that didn't quite measure up. 1   To start the food was horrible   queues were very long to order and then the product you got was quite disappointing given the price. The best food (as well as best value) we experienced was in Disney Village at Earl of Sandwich and unfortunately McDonalds. Had a pizza one day in the park which tasted like a cheap Iceland version, on another day we had a Chicken Burger and were bitterly disappointed with cold food and stale bread! Would definitely recommend making the trip out to Earl of Sandwich where a hot sandwich salad or wrap is cheaper and far better quality! 2   a great number of major attractions were closed for refurbishment and they seem like they may be closed for awhile: Most of Frontier Land (Big Thunder Mountain, Pirate Island, Pocahontas) also Phantom Manor was closed for most of our trip   reopening on our last day; Peter Pan's Flight, Pizza Planet Restaurant, Star Tours. Also in Walt Disney Studios the Aerosmith Rollercoaster, Animagique (pretty sure this is advertised but not actually opened yet), and RC Racer seems to have closures subject to weather. Not sure whether they are preparing for the 25th anniversary next year but bit disappointing for our visit. 3   Long queues and rude people while most of the queuing seemed ok there were some crazy queues for Crush's Coaster (between 55   75 minutes), with no FastPass option we weren't able to go on it as much as we would have liked. Most of Walt Disney Studios did seem to have far longer queues (and less to do) than the main park. Other long queues included Buzz Laser Blast (45), RC Racer (30 ), Autopia (40), Pirates of the Caribbean (45) and Phantom Manor (45). Also beware of rude Europeans trying to push ahead in long queues   from the shuttle bus to ride queues to food lines! 4   Below average shows: really would recommend NOT watching the Stunt Show or Cinemagique, most show attractions were in French and the stunt show definitely doesn't measure up to others I have seen in Universal & Disney USA   really quite average. Otherwise, had a great time, would recommend using FastPass whenever possible. And there seemed to be a quiet time around the main park between 6   9pm for some attractions!

195901726,2,2014-02-01,United States,"We paid hundreds of dollars to wait in line for 3 days for maybe 2 hours of actual rides enjoyment. The only way to do Disneyland is if you have VIP access and can cut to the front of the line whenever you want. We got the 3 day park hopper pass thinking that we would be able to see most attractions in those 3 days. We were sadly mistaken. One would think that the last half of February would see smaller crowds. It's after the Christmas break from school and before spring break. Apparently Southern California schools get a week off for Presidents Day. We arrived shortly after the park opened and parked in the Woody lot. we then had to wait in line to get on a shuttle, about 30 minutes. After the 5 minute ride to the park, we waited in another line to have our bags inspected. This was an absolute joke. After the  security  check, we had to wait in yet another line to get into the park, about 10 minutes. We decided to head to California Adventure and get a fast pass for Radiator Springs Racers. By this point, the park had been open for about an hour and the fast passes were gone for the day. We could wait in line for about an hour and a half if we wanted to ride it, but we still had 2 more days. We'd just get there earlier the next day and gt a fast pass. We found a few rides with short lines, mostly in the  Bugs Life , but those 1 2 minute rides still had waits of 20 minutes. We rode 3 rides at California Adventure in 90 minutes then decided to head over to Disneyland. Waited in another line there to get in, then had to wait to do the classic picture at the entrance. The first ride we went to, the Peter Pan ride took 1 hour and 10 minutes to get through the line, waiting on the 85 degree sun. Then the ride was 2 minutes long at the most. We rode the Autotopia ride next, another hour wait. By this point we had been at the park for about 6 hours total and the kids were done. We checked into our hotel, Courtyard by Marriott Anaheim at Disneyland Resort great place to stay for cheap, and rested up for the next day. We go to the park 30 minutes before they opened the next day and waited in 2 more lines to get into California Adventure to get our Fast pass for Radiator Springs Racers. By the time we got in line, it was almost 1 4 mile long. That is no exaggeration. Waited in line for 1 hour and 20 minutes to get a ticket that says to come back in 6 7 hours and wait in line again. So we went and rode a few more rides and came back to Radiator Springs at our appointed time. When we arrived, the ride was temporarily closed and were told to check back periodically. So we had to stay in California Adventure. After a couple of hours, they decided to close the ride for the rest of the day. Then we had to go wait in line at guest relations to get our name on a list so we could come back the next day and get a pass to ride. This part of Disneyland was great. We gave them our name and when we came back the next day, we picked up a pass for 6 people to get on the ride. There were only 4 of us and only 2 could ride at a time (my daughter is too small). We picked up a family of 4 waiting in line for a fast pass and took them with us. Got right on with no wait and then did the rider swap and got right back on again. Star Tours was another great experience. We got the fast pass earlier then waited only a short while to ride. As the doors opened for us to get on the ride, my son said he needed to go potty. When he says that, there is no holding it, so we went to the bathroom and got a pass to bypass the line and get back on with no waiting. Other than that, Disneyland was a disappointment. The lines and crowds are too much. I would constantly hear from other people in passing,  this is ridiculous, it's just not worth it . An hour wait to spend 1 minute with Mickey, sidewalks and streets that are too crowded to walk down, cars and trolleys driving down the middle of the road causing even more congestion. So glad when it was over.",Disneyland_California
432038967,4,2016-10-01,Denmark,"We decided to drive from Denmark to visit this magical place and even though there were some let downs we had an amazing day in Disneyland. First of all, do not just double check your tickets, triple check them, we made a small mistake (buying  mini  tickets, when it was a non  mini  day) This cost a 84 euro upgrade to use our tickets.Secondly, luckily we were adviced to take the public bus there, cause parking is 20euros?! And thirdly, make sure the park isn't under too much renovations... Almost the whole of the area  Frontierland  was not open and a big chunk of Discovery land  had renovations on it too... But lastly, it is an amazing Park,the rides at both thrilling and masterly made and if you are a Disney fan, you'll love it!   A hint, stay for the end show. Fireworks at 9pm, it's worth it!!

538599201,4,2017-10-01,United Kingdom,"Really enjoyed Disneyland Paris. There's a good range of rides to cater for everyone and the regular parades were great. The queues were really big on some rides, but it does tell you at the start so you can decide if you want to wait.",Disneyland_Paris
446661811,5,2016-11-01,Malaysia,"My hubby decided to choose here over Macau during our HK holiday trip since neither of us have been to any Disneyland yet and this is the closest.I've to say, we enjoyed it thoroughly and with such a fine, cool winter weather end of the year, it make our walk more enjoyable without the sweat during summer time.Although it may be the smallest among all Disneyland, it still took us a full day to walk, ride, eat, shop and we managed to catch two parades; one in the afternoon and the other during night time. The only thing we didn't managed to do was to catch and take a close up photos with all the Disney characters due to the timing that's scheduled.In terms of transportation, there is a direct MTR from Hong Kong station to Disneyland, which you have to interchange at Sunny Bay and you will come across a Mickey Mouse decorated MTR trains to Disneyland. It is advisable to go during weekdays when it is less crowded compared to weekend. Also, with me at my second trimester pregnancy, most of the rides are pregnancy friendly with one or two rides only. To me, this was more than good enough for me as I was able to still enjoy 95% of the rides.I definitely wouldn't mind going back again if I am in HK.",Disneyland_HongKong
289961005,4,2015-07-01,United Kingdom,"This was our first visit to Disneyland Paris though we have visited Disneyland in California and Disneyworld in Florida so we had a fair idea what to expect.We went with our three children (age 16, 13 and 7 years from the 7 10th July, we purchased the four days for the price of three deal for the two park ticket, it was pricey for a family of five though I purchased over two transactions a few months apart in order to spread the cost. We felt that we had a relaxed time having four days, though we could have got round the park in 2 3 days, it was nice to have the extra time which meant that the family went on every ride (dependant on if they wanted to!) and for some rides, they had at least 3 shots! Unfortunately though, we found some of the rides were out of commission and unfortunately, some broke down during the time we were there. Arguably, if you are a hardened Disney parks fan, you may be disappointed by Disneyland Paris, it felt like a cheaper and smaller version of its American counterparts, though if you are looking for a great and rather magical place to take the kids that's a short distance from the UK then Disneyland is your place and it really must be experienced in a lifetime if you can!As a disabled traveller utilising a wheelchair, I found the ground uneven and many  juts  in the paving were rather dangerous, the paving is not always flush and park management need to consider this. I did appreciate the quick access on to various rides, while many of them were not suitable to my particular condition, I found all staff at the rides to be considerate and respectful of my condition. The same could not be said for a handful of members of the public, my children found it rather hurtful that we were glared at when we were supposed to be in the  Happiest Place in the World  just because we were getting on to a ride in front of them. The fact is, staff do not hand out pass cards to just anybody, I had to show proof with my UK disabled blue badge, I also proved that I have walking sticks and a wheelchair. For the  inconvenience  that this caused to the able bodied, perhaps this small handful of individualistic people should consider that my disability does not stop affecting me the minute that I leave the park, nor does my disability ever stop affecting my family, so for their few minutes of  inconvenience  we have a lifetime of inconvenience! Overall, I found the huge majority of staff to be fantastic at their job, a special shout out must go to the lift operator in the Tower of Terror! My husband and kids thought he played the part well and they were very impressed with his range of languages and drama skills! Also, the dancers in the Frozen Sing a Long made it a fantastic and memorable performance for my 7 year old, she was just in awe and was made to feel special. I only experienced one member of staff of whom I would consider as not very friendly though perhaps she was just having a challenging day!Shopping wise, its all a bit repetitive, there are no beanie hats and there is just not the selection of goods like you would find in the American resort parks, though there is something for everyone and you will easily find a gift or two to take home, there are some lovely quirky gifts to be had, though some can be rather pricey too!As a final point, we found many of the restaurants or kiosks were closed, and during a particularly hot spell at the start of the holidays (early July) this was challenging, likewise we found the food to be typically Disney expensive and we found the toilets were not that clean (though that just seems to be France full stop!) though if you study your map then there are some good food to be had, we enjoyed Pizza in Colonel Hathi's Pizza Outpost and the mickey shaped French sable biscuits on Main Street were just lush!Overall, when compared to its American counterparts I would rate this place a three out of five, though for fun factor for the family just a hop across the pond from the UK and the whole magic of Disney for the kids and adults alike, I would rate Disneyland Paris as a four out of five.",Disneyland_Paris
374695583,5,2016-05-01,United States,"We love taking an adults Disney trip every few years! Here are a few tips and our favorite things to do if you're going as adults and in a small group: Get to the park at opening. Yes, there will be families there at the same time, but in my experience they head toward Fantasyland or stop for breakfast, etc. Hit the busiest rides first, before they get too crowded...Space Mountain, Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, Indiana Jones, etc.  Utilize  single rider  passes! Many rides offer these. You'll still get to hang out together during the line, and you most likely will not sit together, but it is a good way to ride the popular attractions without wasting hours in line. There are times we have ended up seated in the same vehicle. We use this option for Indiana Jones, Space Mountain, Radiator Springs Racers, California Screamin, etc.  Get Fast Passes for the rides you can't do Single Rider (or don't want to separate on)...Splash Mountain, Big Thunder Mountain, Tower of Terror... Blue Bayou is a fun option for lunch or dinner",Disneyland_California

195517801,4,2014-01-01,Australia,I went with a group of 3 friends to Disneyland Hong Kong in January 2014. We had a fun day wearing Mickey ears and being able to be big kids for a day. I have been to Disneyland Anaheim and this is a great copy of the original. The parade was wonderful and the lion king show spectualar. I still had that wonderful Disney feeling but it wasn't as good as the original. I would still strongly advise to go for at least 1 day. The customer service was great and the atmosphere was excellent. I had a FANTASTIC day and have great memories that I will always treasure. Thank you Disney for another great day.,Disneyland_HongKong

449804083,5,2016-12-01,India,"It was my 6 yrs old daughter's dream to meet her favorite Disney stars. To be honest, my HK trip was Disneyland centric alone as places like Dubai have better tourist attractions than HK. We booked Disneyland tickets via Klook a month in advance and availed good discounts!Reaching Disneyland is so very easy... The HK Disneyland is located on the Lantau Island near the airport. You can either take a Disney Resort MTR Line, a taxi, a public bus or a coach. We stayed at Panda hotel and it took less than 45 min for us to reach there.If you are travelling by MTR, change for Disney Resort Line at Sunny Bay Station. This is a direct dedicated line to the Disneyland with a frequency of 4 10 minutes. Bus R33 (to Tuen Mun Railway Station) and R42 (to Tai Wai Railway Station) operate 20 minutes after the fireworks display. In Sundays and public holidays, Bus R33 and R42 run from Tuen Mun and Tai Wai to the Resort Public Transportation Interchange at 09:00, 09:20 and 09:45.The Disney Resort Line is a themed MTR train with Mickey Mouse shaped windows and comfortable sofas. This MTR brings you straight to the Disneyland station from where you can walk up to the entrance counters. The queue starts almost 1 hour before park opening. Your vouchers are converted to regular tickets only through the entrance. Being a small park it can be seen back to front in nearly 5 hours. Wear comfortable shoes as you have to walk a lot and stand in long queues at times. As someone suggested here already, consider going deep into the park to Adventureland or Tomorrowland and then work your way back     you   ll skip the crowds and queues will be shorter. I had clearly read here that visitors head straight to the character meet and greets near the entrance when the gates open and the queues build there up pretty fast... However with a 6 year old dying to meet her favorite characters i too didnt have a choice but to add to the queue :) Light snacks were allowed without any fuss inside the park. The staff was very helpful and courteous. Own water and juice was allowed too. The free WIFI service inside the park was good enough for us to share our memories in real time. Ensure to check out the time and place of the meet & greet of all the Disney characters from the guide map available in the park's entrance. Each Disney character is out only for a short time (approx. 30 mins) so get there early or you won't get to meet them. The food at the restaurants wasn't too attractive or delicious however we still had a heavy meal to stay active until the fireworks. We were free in the evening but were eager to stay till the Paint the Night parade and the fireworks. So we grabbed the best seats on the benches right in front of the Sleeping Beauty Castle. Even though the weather looks pleasant ensure to carry warm clothes during winters as staying out in open for the shows can give you a wind chill effect. I personally found the oe day ticket to be good enough as we with planning we covered everything and enjoyed nearly 99% of the attractions. I used the fast pass for Space Mountain and one more ride and it worked like a charm, no long queues :) Though everyone says DON'T BRING SELFIE STICK which i even confirmed with Disneyland team, i could still see a lot of guests with these sticks inside the park. As suggested by someone here i took an autograph book and got many characters happily sign it. My daughter went gaga over our idea and is still very thankful. Thanks to my dear Tripadvisor friend for that suggestion!Keep enough space and charge on your cameras phones for videos and pictures until the fireworks as you would love to capture every moment for a lifetime. Disneyland is must visit for people of all age. My wife and i enjoyed the Cinderella Carousel like kids... The video recording still brings smiles to our faces :)",Disneyland_HongKong

Then there are the lines. Every ride has at least a 30 minute wait. We actually waited for 2:37 minutes for Space Mountain because the ride broke twice while we were in line. They did not do anything to accommodate waiting for their premier ride that broke twice on us. VERY DISAPPOINTING. The best part of the experience is that they did not rip you off on the food prices. Plenty of places to eat under $10 ppl.I do not see any circumstance that I will return. I would much rather go to Disney World as it is much bigger and better for adults.",Disneyland_California

We made the decision to head to the park later in the afternoon and then stay until closing, hopefully missing the large crowds and lines with this plan. Overall, we were very successful! The longest line we ever had to wait in was about 20 30 minutes (not bad, for Disneyland), and we got to ride everything we wanted to. If you traveling and able to stay out late, I would definitely recommend that route. I would also recommend not purchasing the food in the park. We brought a backpack full of snacks each evening and rented a locker ($7 per day). I do think this saved us money.Disneyland is a magical place certainly worth visiting.

We had a cast member screaming at us because we scan our own tickets ,while she opened the door for another family with a buggy, this cast member went on to follow us,shouting at us and pointing her finger,She has got to be the worst Cast Member I had come across in the 10 years,we have been going, utterly disgraceful carry on.On a personal note ,if anyone is thinking of booking for this year  don't  you will not get your Value for money.When the park is at uts beay with all the rides opened, it really is a magical place,we just got the most rudes French girl,I have even came across and in hindsight shoul have reported her to city hall.",Disneyland_Paris

Better facilities on South West trains!Really appreciated the luggage service with Eurostar to Disney hotels. Worth going for as you can go straight to the park when you arrive at 1.30pm.Disneyland Paris was as I expected, from reading the previous reviews. It only rained on 2 of our 3 days, so we were lucky. Beware of puddles everywhere   my only pair of shoes got soaked on the first day. Better take more than one pair of shoes with you.There are too many smokers around the park   even in the open air I could smell smoke everywhere, and it should be banned while queuing   most of the queues are partly inside and it's dreadful to have all that smoke in a closed atmosphere and you can't escape! I will be writing to DP requesting that smoking be banned in queues and ideally throughout the park with designated outside areas marked for smokers.Food expensive. Tea dreadful   got cup of hot milk and water, with a tea bag to put in. Had to throw it away. Suggest you drink coffee instead.But me and my family with 2 children of 7 and 8 really enjoyed our stay. You can only do rides easily for the first and last hours. In between lots of queues, but we can only go at peak times as my husband is a teacher.The parade was excellent. Remembered to sit down near the barrier early this time to get good view.The fact that the park is small is a plus in my view. We still didn't see and do everything in 2.5 days and it is less tiring going from one thing to another. I wouldn't have wanted the park to be any bigger.Stayed at Hotel Cheyenne   excellent   have written a review on the Hotel Cheyenne section of this website.We enjoyed it, but I do wish that smoking was banned in the park.

This one has a bit of individuality compared to the other two. If your going with a family of kids or thrillseeking teenagers its the place to go. It has the best weather out of the lot aswell and so many choices of hotels nearby. The adventure park is more for the older ones whereas the normal one has all the disney characters. In the adventure park the rides I would recommend for thrill seekers are the twilight tower of terror, California screaming and a few others. I would NOT recommend the sun wheel for people who are overweight (dad) as it is a scary experience and the swinging gondolas will flip over! Food nothing too expensive usual restuarants, dine with the characters and then the hot dog carts.

The magic doesn't fade with age, even my boyfriend (who is nowhere near the Disney fanatic I am) enjoyed himself. Magical experience for all ages. Firework show particularly amazing. Yes, prices are extortion for gifts food drink and yes, there a long queues for rides and character meets... What do people expect when visiting one of the biggest attractions in the world?!? Can't compare to Disney USA as I have never been, but perfect to have a European version to help those like me who will probably never be able to afford the trip to USA. Also, Paris itself is an amazing city well worth the visit, so great location. Overall, AMAZING!!!!!!!",Disneyland_Paris

Worth staying up that bit later to see. The rides were fun. Again busy but what else do you expect when you go in summer holidays. Little resturants dotted around the park, that you will pay a arm and leg for not the best tasting food but hey ho I think we lived off pop corn and Planet Hollywood which is in the Disney Village. A fantastic park and don't let the staff get you down as some of them are misrable but for most of them, they are lovely and helpful.

394130866,5,2016-06-01,United States,"I'm very impressed with Disneyland, especially compared to Disney World. While many attractions are relatively the same, there are little differences that make it better. Anyone who loves Disney World, will absolutely love Disneyland. The best part is that park hopping is a breeze. Disneyland, Disney's California Adventure, and Downtown Disney are all just a short walk from one another.",Disneyland_California
452169225,5,2017-01-01,United States,"We (7 of us, 3 generations) had two days at Disneyland earlier this month. One day was sunny and warm, and the other was very rainy  but we loved every minute of it.One complaint: Apparently Autopia closes when it rains. But they don't tell you that's a possibility. We waited over a half hour in line, watching the clouds roll in and the drizzle turn to a downpour. Then an attendant abruptly stated that  the ride is closing, please exit to your left.  Pretty hard to explain to a 5 year old boy patiently waiting to drive his own car....And a bit of advice: Disneyland is ALWAYS crowded. We checked a website that presumably could predict attendance levels. On a day they projected crowd level to be  Ghost Town,  it was just as busy as the sunny weekend day we had spent there. Plan on crowds. Go early. Use Fast Pass.Yes, Disneyland is expensive. Plan in advance. It's worth it.",Disneyland_California

241904677,5,2014-11-01,United States,"We visited Disneyland the second week of November this year. We were originally hoping that this would be a  slow  time in the park because the recent Halloween time was over and the Christmas rush would not have begun. The park was not as slow as we had imagined. My husband and two young adult sons enjoyed a 5 day park hopper experience. This gave us enough time to enjoy all of the big attractions that we love and attend shows, smaller attractions and all the shopping we had planned. The weekends are always very crowded in the park and this timing did not prove any different. The crowds were high on Saturday the 8th and Sunday the 9th. We were hoping it would slow down on Monday but it turns out that a lot of people were attending through the Veteran's Day holiday on Tuesday the 11th.The crowds finally thinned out on Wednesday the 12th, but the park hours were shortened, probably for this very reason. We were disappointed that the park closed at 8pm that final night for us, that seemed early and not a good trade off for lower attendance.We were able to use the Fast Pass system much to our advantage and stood in single rider lines for big attractions such as Radiator Springs Racers in Disney California Adventure or the Matterhorn Bobsleds in Disneyland. I recommend getting to the park half an hour before opening to get through security and the entrance gates to wait in the roped off areas in order to ride very long wait time attractions such as Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage or  it's a small world  or Peter Pan's Flight. I also recommend using the Disneyland Railroad to access points around the park that have attractions you wish to visit. For example, it is much easier to hop aboard the train in Tomorrowland and skip the parade crowds to get to New Orleans Square especially when the main access routes begin to get roped off for an upcoming event such as the fireworks display.I advise folks to eat at times that are just a little earlier or later than everyone else at lunch and dinner. Up to an hour of time could be lost just waiting in a lunch line from noon to 2 pm. We enjoyed a few pieces of fruit and a Dole whip in Adventureland for breakfast and then grabbed a few skewers at the nearby Bengal Barbecue before leaving that area.Food is always pricey, about twenty dollars per adult per meal at any of the large, cafeteria style dining options. A burger or piece of pizza can be had for about ten dollars at Tomorrowland Terrace or Redd Rockett's Pizza Port but be prepared to buy cold water, churros, pretzels or popcorn on impulse as needed and don't forget to have cash on hand when a balloon vendor appears with a giant handful of Big Hero 6 balloons! In California Adventure Park, The World of Color show still put a tear in our eye even though we have witnessed it before it is a must see! We were given VIP seating for this event with our reservation package dinner at the Carthay Circle Restaurant; this dinner was delicious and the service was superb, but online reservations are convenient and helpful.With or without small children, the Disney's Aladdin A Musical Spectacular is really fun, if you don't have little ones, you might try going to the latest showing of the day as the kiddos might get worn out and the last show may be less crowded.In Disneyland we had our pictures taken with the Thor and Captain America characters in the Innoventions attraction. This was a lot of fun even though we had to wait about 30 minutes for each of them.The Indiana Jones Adventure ride was not functioning well while we were there. We were stranded once on the ride during a stoppage for about 15 minutes and the ride was closed for technical reasons several times during our first 4 days and closed completely on our last day.With a little organization the wait times can be minimal, just plan for what you enjoy the most, get a daily schedule to see show, parade and fireworks times and be flexible. We love Disneyland and California Adventure Parks and will return in the future.",Disneyland_California

The music shows are excellent, so when I needed a break from Mickey, I took in a show. My fav: Alladin and World of Color. Both were just wonderful! I have a gluten allergy...I dreaded eating in the park. Do not fear, fellow gluten free friends. Disney is the best! A chef always came and talked to me, if we ate at a 'sit down' restaurant. The walk up food was equally aware of gluten allergies. So not a hassle ever!

Everyhing seemed so worn out and the park itself is quite small. Apart from Pirates of the Caribian and Mystery Mansion (which was ok) the main attraction is a Starwars simulator, which dont compare at all to what you will find at Universal Studios 3d simulators. The park does not compare to Eurodisnay (which is great) our own (Denmark's) Tivoli or EuropaPark. The latter is the greatest park i have ever attended.

168781436,2,2013-07-01,United States,"We love Disney. For one day, we buy into the dream, the gimmicks, the fun. We've been to both Disney parks in the US and others internationally. This summer, we got to add Disney Paris to the list. We had high expectations based on our other experiences. Ultimately, we had a lovely day, so I can't be too hard on Disney Paris. We loved the castle!! BUT, there were two main problems that we had that really could be fixed. First, the majority of rides were either down all day or not functioning for large parts of the day. Fast pass was useless. We spent a lot of time walking from ride to ride only to find they were closed. Or, worse yet, we'd be standing in long queues for a ride and it would shut down. Second, the staff need to smile, make eye contact, and otherwise appear to like their job. I mean, really, it's Disney!! Many of the ride food staff just looked irritated and distracted. For this reason, I am glad Disney Paris was not our first Disney experience, or we'd be totally turned off. The one exception, was a most enjoyable young man working at the Tower of Terror. The ride had technical difficulty (see above problem) while we were in line and he made an effort to make it fun for everyone. At the end of the day, we approached customer service and reported our experience to them. To their credit, they offered us free tickets to return on another day. The tickets, however, could only be used at Disney Paris which was not an option for us. So, they gave my daughter a small stuffed animal instead. I hope that they listen to feedback and at least try to make some improvements. Smiles are free!",Disneyland_Paris

The opening hours were 10am   11pm and we stayed the whole time we just couldn't get enough! The ride queues weren't too long   maximum wait was for thunder mountain at 1hr and that did feel a drag as you're crammed in a queue. We did space mountain twice though so weren't put off at all, guess its to be expected. There are lots of shows throughout the day, we planned one around lunch time and ate our picnic during the show, and the parade at 5.30pm had all the characters. The finale light show at closing time was simply amazing   I had goosepimples throughout! Meet and greet character queues were long so we didn't do those but the parade made up for it as we saw everyone. Pirates of the Caribbean and Phantom Manor could do with updating as they were a bit dated and almost out of keeping with the fantastic quality of themed decoration on other rides. Toilets were clean and around every corner as was water dispensers. The shops have a range of prices goods clothing seemed expensive but key rings sweets and pencils were all ok. The food is the only let down   everything is calorific fast food and is all very expensive for what it is but you don't have much choice once on the site   we paid   40 for four hot dog meals!!!!!!!Don't recommend you try and do two parks in one day   Parc Disneyland has so much to offer you can't possibly squeeze in anything else if it's your first visit.

We bought the night ticket and entered Disneyland at 7p.m. We waited for around half an hour to visit each ghost house. The ghost house is not very terrifying; suitable for elder children    it took around 10 15 minutes to walk through the ghost house. The night parade is exactly like its television advertisement. The children were excited but it is not that attractive to adults. Firework at the castle was amazing; it starts at 21:00 every night.

524616715,5,2017-09-01,United Kingdom,We went on a family trip here with a mix of ages and everyone had a fantastic time. My family had all been to Disney world in Orlando and this certainly my held up. This park has been very well put together and well thought out. If your reading this you probably already have a good idea of what to expect from a Disney park but here are some tip we learnt on our trip. Top tips Went trying to get from the gate to the castle hub use the arcades either side of Main Street they car covered if it's rainy and much quieter if you are just looking to head to the rides. Big thunder mountain fast pass is one of the first to run out most days so grab that first. Waiting to meet Micky in his meet and greet in fantasy land isn't as bad as it look because although the wait rarely drops below 40 min. All the queuing is in front of a cinema screen showing cartoon which kept the kids entertained. If your with small kids eat at cafe hyperion in discovery land it's is very large which means there is always space to spread out. The food here was consistently good and they show Star Wars rebels cartoon all in all the most restful quick service in the park.Take the time to explore adventure isle! ,Disneyland_Paris

211604363,5,2014-03-01,Australia,We took the train from Mongkok then changed to a Disney theme direct train to Disneyland. We arrived around 2pm and we had bought a voucher entry ticket from a supermarket in town (I can't remember the name but it was like 7 11 there're everywhere). First we went to redeem our actual entry ticket on one of the self service kiosk out the front which was easy. We then went in and had lunch in one of the restaurant which all seems to be reasonably priced for a theme park. Pick up the brochure schedule and we found there's a parade starts at 3.30pm and fireworks at 8pm and that's when they'd block off pathways for the parade so we just stationed outside the restaurant and watched the parade which goes for 30mins. we then check out some rides and head out to see the firework where again most rides are closing off. We found that arrived around 2pm gave us plenty of time to enjoy most rides (some we weren't interested) and weren't too tired to stay for the firework. However we decided to leave just before the end of firework and head back to the train to beat the crowd which I'd recommended. I imagine if you have kids it would've been exhausting spent a whole day at the park but arriving in the afternoon at least they'd have morning to rest up.,Disneyland_HongKong
334258516,4,2015-12-01,United States,"I'm used to going to the Anaheim park and the HK park wasn't as small as I expected. There are definitely not a lot of rides compared to Anaheim and Orlando, but it's still an overall, fun experience if you love Disney. There seems to be space for them to add more rides. The parades seem to be similar to the ones in Anaheim, but with fewer floats. Some of the food is pretty expensive for what it is   I wish there was an option to not get a drink with the meal at a lower cost since you're able to bring your own drinks into the park (not your own food   snacks though). The park is not terribly crowded compared to the U.S. parks and Tokyo parks and if you go early, you can avoid having to wait in line for the rides at all. The lines to take pictures with the characters though are so much slower than in the U.S.   the characters spend a lot more time interacting with you and the cast members don't really move you through efficiently like in the U.S. and they'll let you take a ton of pictures with, what seems to be, every combination of individuals in your group   this makes it painfully slow for people in line. The merchandise is also good   mostly different than what they sell in the U.S. (cuter), but not as cute as what they sell in the Tokyo parks   still just as expensive as what you would pay in the U.S. though. Also, if you're using a U.S. credit card   it seemed that for all transactions in the park and to buy the entrance tickets, they will ask if you want to charge in USD or HKD   if you say USD, they tack on a  fee  to the exchange rate. I would recommend saying HKD if you have a credit card with no foreign transaction fees (e.g. Capital One). On a side note, there's a Disney Store at the HK airport that sells almost the same things that they sell in the park if you don't have a chance to visit.",Disneyland_HongKong

The castle in the California one is smaller in comparison but I think this was the first Disney park so it's not a deal breaker. Plenty of different rides for all ages. If you want to enjoy the two parks thoroughly, I think it's best to be here for two days; one for each park. We only went to the Disney park and not the California adventure as we didn't want a crazy day going back and forth with the park hopper. Another thing I was able to compare was the food theming seems a bit better at the other parks I had previously been to. Only saw a mickey pretzel. The merchandise was good. Queues weren't too bad and we managed to go on most of the rides. Only the Matterhorn ride was closed. We booked with Lux Bus America and they picked us up from our hotel.

Here is the  1 reason why  I purchased the  Unofficial Guide to Disneyland  book a few weeks before we arrived, selected which of the step by step tour itineraries the book has, cut it out and took it with us the day we went to Disneyland Park. I cannot tell you what a huge difference this made  we saw & rode everything we were most interested on a busy Spring Break day at the park and the longest line we stood in was maybe 20 minutes. We passed rides we had been on earlier in the day with a 5 minute wait then which later had people standing in line for 75 90 minutes!! My kids couldn't believe what a difference our experience was from what they saw happening to others who apparently came without a plan or with a plan that clearly wasn't working for them. I used the book twice at WDW and the same exact experience happened there. My husband looked at me at one point and said  What is going on? We've been ahead of the crowds all morning!  I replied,  It's because of the guidebook!  Do yourself a favor and buy the book and follow it exactly. It requires you get up EARLY on your vacation time which is hard for some people but would you rather get up early and have short lines or sleep in and stand in line for 90 minutes for a 3 minute ride?

Magic hoursAnother benefit to Disney hotels, get access to the park 2 hours before everyone else, which is priceless if you have young children.Meal vouchers Use your meal vouchers to upgrade to the Wild West show, which then becomes excellent value and a very entertaining event for the whole family. Also can do the same for the character breakfast.Plan your ridesYou will be surprised how few rides you end up going on, so plan what you want to do and go to those during magic hours.Fast passFast pass gives you priority access to cut down waiting times. Remember that you can only hold one at any time so use early in the day.Character breakfastA fabulous buffet breakfast and an easy way for your kids to meet some characters. Use your meal vouchers to upgrade cheaply.Photopass autographs Unless you want to spend your day queuing in the rain, don't bother. Will suck up your time and your enthusiasm.MoneySuspend you understanding of the value of money, Disney have. Just go with it and remember you are making memories for your family. Then come home and sell an organ to pay your credit card bill!",Disneyland_Paris

243510195,5,2014-12-01,United Kingdom,"Our fourth time at Disneyland Paris, we have also had eight visits to Walt Disney World and also visited Disneyland California. People of ten ask about comparing the different parks. For me that is pointless. In Florida you have the weather and WDW is a holiday destination on its own. In California you can spend a couple of days in Disney and then lots of time visiting the rest of region. And now Paris. Having took off from Birmingham airport UK at 7.45 last Thursday, we arrived inside Disneyland Resort at 10am! Wow! Using the 10 minute TGV train makes such a big difference. So for us European's Paris is so convenient, but visitors are also little over 30 minutes away from Paris itself, one of the worlds greatest cities. So, rather than compare, accept each for their benefits and enjoy them all if possible!This year we visited exactly the same time as last year, primarily to enjoy the Christmas celebrations. Unfortunately it wasn't quite as good as last year, the day time parade and evening parade were not running, just replaced by the Christmas Cavalcade running three times per day. That's a shame but I suppose we must understand the financial difficulties recently faced, accept it, and enjoy what is there rather than worrying about what isn't. When visiting, do try if you can and stick to weekdays. On Thursday and Friday the park was busy, but not too bad. Not too much queueing and easy to get a good position for the parade and fireworks without the need to queue for an hour or so beforehand. On Saturday it was manic. Most attractions had wait times of between one and two hours and the crowds were so big that just navigating the park was a challenge!In my (our) opinion, this is most beautiful Disney park of all. Simply stunning. We think the castle is the best and the size of park being a little smaller than Magic Kingdom makes it more intimate and easy to appreciate it all.My (our) opinion of the attractions:Disney Dreams of Christmas:The Paris, Christmas version is very similar to Wishes in WDW but at this time of year has the Christmas theme. It really is wonderful and you cannot miss it. It is a combination of a laser show, fireworks, projected film onto the castle and great Christmas music.Christmas Cavalcade Parade:As an additional parade last year it was absolutely perfect. Now it is the only one it does feel a little short. That said, it is full of Christmas spirit and the characters play their roles really well.Princesses Promenade:We mist this on Thursday and Friday. But, just about saw it on Saturday. Crowds were massive. A nice little show though mainly for the kids.Characters:Our main comment was that there seems much more variety in Paris than Florida. Not just your usual characters but out and about we saw the entire 'Duck' family, Merida from Brave. Characters from Nightmare before Christmas, Pinocchio and friends, Darth Vader, and the princesses from Frozen even walked by!Big Thunder Mountain:Broek down for a time on Thursday but thankfully was working again on Friday. One of our real favourites and seems longer and more exciting than its big sister in WDW.Buzz Lightyear:Always good fun and this time was no exception. That said, now Toy Story Mania in WDW is so good, it makes this feel a little dated.Discovery and Liberty Arcades:At the rear of the shops running up and down both sides of Main Street USA. This is just beautiful and we commented what a nice addition it is to the style of Main St. Lovely. Disneyland Railroad:Such a nice and relaxing way to get around the park. A proper old steam train and great old carriages. It's a Small World:Another attraction that seems more detailed and slightly better than WDW. No visit is complete without visiting. Added bonus that even on busy days, queueing isn't too bad. Phantom Manor:The Paris version of Haunted Mansion and again, in our opinion a better attraction than WDW. It is a great attraction for everyone and not to scary for the children.Pirates of the Caribbean:This is possibly the best attraction in the park, longer than WDW and with a couple of drops as you boat moves through the attraction. We were lucky as only a 10 minute wait on Friday. By Saturday is was 90 minutes!Hopefully, you get the message that we do love it here. A wonderful place with great atmosphere and so very convenient as well. We WILL return!",Disneyland_Paris
164659400,5,2013-03-01,Japan,"The place is wonderful... A kingdom for kids and young adult. You should avoid weekend since it is over crowded.

The Snow White Princess, birds, bees, butterflies giant flowers that mobile Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse ... dancing in the street, connected together walking around the park.

How wrong I was ! From the moment was arrived at Sunny Bay station to transfer to the Disney line you could see the theming staff in unform, disney colours and the disney train with mouse ear windows and statues of characters inside. The entry plaza and water feature were great ! I was really worried after reading reviews on this site that the teenager would be bored but we ride space mountain 6 times and the Buzz lightyear ride 5 times and still missed many rides. The food was less expensive than we thought, the queues were a lot shorter also. We visited on April 22nd. The Lion King show was almost a feature theatre performance in its own right ! Loved our day at disney and we all could have done it again the next day as we ran out of time to see everything ! Some staff are better than others  the first time we did the jungle cruise the guide was hilarious but the second time the girl we got was simply reading a script (or it sounded like that). nothwithstanding a great place to visit even if you don't have kids ! Only negative was that the only ATMS are all the way back at the main entry point so a bit of a hike !",Disneyland_HongKong

601249718,4,2017-08-01,United Kingdom,"This was my first ever time going to a Disney Park, and it was a very special experience, since it was mine and my husbands'  BabyMoon  before our baby came along. Long story short, the park itself truly is magical. The cast members make every encounter special, their multi lingual talent is truly amazing and the amenities and functionalities of the park are so well thought out and managed, that it's easy to feel like a child and get lost in the wonder around every corner. We did not use a fast pass on this occasion, but if rides are what you're after, I could definitely see the value in that, especially if you're going after the BIG ticket ones. (it wasn't so bad for my husband, since I wasn't allowed on most of the rides, so he went in the much faster single rider queue.) That being said, the park isn't as pregnancy friendly as I would have liked. A surprising amount of even the most docile of rides (slow on rail story rides) are forbidden for pregnant women entirely (I am not stupid, obviously pregnant women are not allowed on high speed anything)... but Aladdin's Magic Carpets?? That was rather surprising. Also, while visitors with reduced mobility can avail of a special reserved spot for the parade for their safety and comfort, this was not made available, even to highly pregnant women, which I found concerning, since the densely packed crowd at the parade and fireworks made for a very dangerous amount of flying elbows and running children, that I had to fight to keep from my belly. Shame. But all in all, it was a great experience. The music, the characters, the design, the shows, the food... it was pure magic, and for the most part, I felt like a child again. I can't wait to go back without being pregnant, since then it must be even better. (My honest advice is, if you REALLY want those cute baby bump with Mickey Mouse photos, go ahead, but even as a die hard Disney fan, I would personally not recommend the parks for a baby moon to anyone else; I felt like I spent a lot of money to look at stuff I wasn't allowed to do.)",Disneyland_Paris
246909122,2,2014-12-01,United States,"Customer does not matter here anymore. once they get your money for the ticket their customer service stops. once inside the gates you are treated as you are no one and not important to anyone. they could care less if you spend 5 minutes or 5 hours at the park. they have your money and that is all that matters to them. was our first and last time we will visit disneyland. was a big disappointment for whole family., ages 10 52.",Disneyland_California

I had so much fun on this magical adventure. The only complaint I have is it's really crowded and your fast pass really does nothing for you.

Then head to Walk Disney Studios after lunch, there is a stunt show, however it drags out a bit, this is mostly said in French, however some is in English. The best part was the tram ride which takes you through movie scenes and even shows you a movie set, where a truck explodes, water comes tumbling down the rocks and you get wet, it was so fun!!!

And some of the rides are quite old now and has not changed for some time. Our biggest disappointment was there was nothing from frozen? The biggest grossing film? Someone said it was big in florida disney? So it could be on it's way. Don't get me wrong it's still a magical place and I love it. My advice would be go in the week. ",Disneyland_Paris

What i wud recommend is to get to the help desk tour guide and first find out the show timings of sum of the must see shows, as they r limited shows in a day, n the place is so huge that u may fail to keep a track of the timing, n the location of the shows. especially if u r on a 1 day ticket to disneyland. The lion king show shud not missed. each n evry thing is soo much fun. But it does not have any dare devil rides...i was glad abt that..but m sure not all. There is a space ride, which is a roller coaster ride in the space...which is the only adventurous ride and it is not recommended to ppl who hate roller coasters. but if u r young, physically fit(read no spondylosis) n can gather sum courage, i recommend that u dont miss it. i did it twice. also, avoid going there during the june  august period, for obvious reasons, rain, n hot weather both at the same time. n u wont be able to enjoy the rides much. the place is so clean that u can even sit on the roads while watching the disney parade. n yes the firework show at he end of the day, is so magical dreamy n beautiful. dont miss it for anything in this world.n ya ..the food...i did not like anything there..veg n non veg both suck, so plz carry sumthing wid u..not sure if they allow it or not. yes..but the ice creams there r good.",Disneyland_HongKong

Was dead but, this was like half 7 in the morning! Throughout the day it did get busier and hotter but that didn't spoil the Disney Magic! We did as much as we can in Disneyland before heading over to Disney California adventure. We missed a few rides but that didn't matter as we bought the 3 day park hopper which was very good value! I would recommend all the rides in the park. Just be aware that Splash Mountain fastpass can run out quite quickly so either try going on this early in the day or if you don't mind waiting 45 60 minutes in the queue. Disney California Adventure was our kind of park, had a bit more thrill rides than Disneyland but that didn't matter of course! World of Color is a must see show! Its probably one of the best shows I've seen in a park. Would highly recommend Tower of Terror, which turned out to be our favorite ride! Didn't mind waiting 45 minutes for it either!

The best rides for adults and kids over 7 were Hyperspace Mountain and Big Grizzly runaway minecars. When it comes to food I highly recommend taking snacks and water. With the water though you can fill them up at the water stations.

15933992,3,,United Kingdom,"Went with my sister and three girls aged 9, nearly 7 and 4.Be prepared to queue. Even for rides like the tea cups we queued over 20 minutes. The bigger rides were over an hour. They have a fast pass system on certain rides which means you put your park ticket in a machine and get a ticket with an alloted time to go on the ride. Although they advertise that you can have five fast passes a day read the small print which says you can only have one fast pass at a time. So our idea of getting fast passes at the beginning of the day for 5 rides went badly wrong!Oh did I also mention that you have to queue to get a fast pass..grrrr.Our girls do not like scary rides so did not go on 'big thrill' rides. In Disney our favourites were Peter Pan..feels a bit like you are flying, Buzz Lightyear..you are in a carriage shooting aliens with guns..great fun, Its a Small World..a boat trip around countries (the girls loved this but I found it a bit spooky..don't like those dolls!).In Walt Disney Studios Park...Stitch Live was really impressive.If your kids don't like to be scared then watch out for the 3d honey I shrunk...it has realistic 3d snakes and other scaries. In the Studios Park the film tour bus ride special effects bit was impressive but it really scared the kids so be careful if they don't like fire and water! Don't want to post a spoiler but if you want to know more then email me. The Snow White ride was also full of witches and may be a bit scary for young kids.The 5pm parade was lovely, a really nice end to the day. Talking of characters if your kids want to do the autographs then try and catch the characters on walk about if you can...we queued for over an hour in 26 degree heat to get minnies photo and signature..worth it for the photo..they take a professional photo which you can buy and ours was a really nice momento but still a long time to wait. I would only do this for one character and only if they really want to. The queue did not seem that big but everyone in front had a signature and a photo so be warned as the queue did not move!High School Musical Parade is also on in Disney studio at the moment and the kids loved it (and me too if I am honest!).Didn't get chance to see the shows as the queues were just too big..come on Disney sort out advance booking for the shows as there was a huge queue an hour before the show doors even opened...too long to wait with young children.Anyway feel free to email with any questions, happy to help if I can!",Disneyland_Paris

That being said, if you are patience and well informed, you can make the most of your trip. My biggest recommendation is two fold.  First, go early, then take a break so you can stay late. The park starts getting crowded after 10, so if you can, get there when it opens. Take a break in the middle of the day (there is no point in being one of those angry crabby people during fireworks). Come back at around 4 5. You will be refreshed and ready to finish out your trip. Second  PREPLAN   I constantly marvel at people who do not take advantage of Fastpasses, and how many arguments I have heard between families regarding what to do next. Take the time in line to figure out where you want to go next. Be okay with walking back and forth across the park. Also take advantage of the vast number of fan sights that can give you tips on were to sit for fireworks, scheduling of all the street shows and other little tidbits that make Disneyland an immersive experience.",Disneyland_California

651604695,5,2019-01-01,Australia,"Sure, after Anaheim, this park is small. But so much fun. We travelled with our 3 year old and it was perfect for him. We enjoyed 3 days in the park. You can't quite see everything in 1 day   2 is perfect and 3 just gave us the luxury of time to see everything with time to spare. We were blown away by the shows   Mickey and the Wonderous Book and The Lion King are incredible. Skip Moana if you are on a schedule. Rides aren't that thrilling, but definitely good fun. Disney has this amazing knack for making kids rides that are fun for adults too! Toy Story Land's parachute drop is the best!! Make sure you get there at rope drop to maximise your time in the park. Food is expensive, but good enough. Choose week days for low crowds   we were there 2nd week of Jan and crowds were good. Take the train (MTR)   it's part of the experience and easy to do with some planning. Saved money by buying tickets on klook   easy to use. Often can get a discount vouchers for shops on main street between 10 and 10.30 while waiting for rope drop for rest of park. They can store your parcels and collect at end of day.Consider booking a character meal (e.g. breakfast at Disney hotel) to get those great character snaps  saves you needing to line up during that precious park time!",Disneyland_HongKong
210661437,5,,United States,"My family and I visited Disneyland on 6 9 14 and had the best time. Our two sons (6 and 3) loved every minute of the packed day. We arrived at 8:00, stayed until 9:00 PM, rode 15 rides, participated in the Jedi show, watched the parade, met Mickey, Minnie, Thor, Captain America and many others, and had two delicious meals at Redd Rockets and Cafe Orleans. It was a packed and amazing day. Every employee we met was extremely friendly and went out of their way to make the day special for our boys. Disneyland is truly the happiest place on earth!",Disneyland_California
238341320,5,2014-10-01,United Kingdom,"We stayed at the hotel Cheyenne within Disney for 4 nights. We arrived late at night and checked in easy. The hotel is exactly what you would expect. There is a restaurant on site where you go for breakfast. The breakfast selection isn't great but it does say when booking its a continental buffet breakfast. You get toast, butters, chocolate spread, croissants butter and chocolate, breads, ham & cheese. There is a nice bar in the hotel which is expensive but the waiters are good fun and will help you decide on which cocktail to try! There is also a disney shop within the hotel which sells mainly souvenirs and toys. Also a small arcade but it isn't up to much. The rooms are clean and tidy and located close to the main hub of the hotel. I must note there is a strange smell to the hotel and rooms but think this is meant to be part of the Wild West theme. The bus stop to take you to the parks is right outside the hotel and comes every few minutes. Excellent service. When you get to the parks entrance is quick although they do check your bags. If you stay in a Disney hotel you can enter the parks 2 hours before other visitors which helps not queuing for rides.Disneyland park is a magical setting as you walk through seeing the castle. We took our 4 year old girl and she almost burst with excitement when she saw the castle which looks like the ones in princess movies. We queued a couple of times to see characters which is well worth it as she loved it and they don't rush you when you are with the characters. The parades are worth watching. Make sure you watch each one as when we went each one was different. The 5.30 parade was the best as it had frozen characters on it. The ride queues can get long but if you get fast track tickets which are free it really helps. We queued 2 and a half hours to meet a princess the ah back of the park but it was well worth it! Our little one met Tiana and it is pot luck who you see when you get to the front but you get to purchase professional pictures at the end. ( a good little tip is wait by the entrance to the attraction and you will see the princesses come and go as they swap with each other) the food is expensive so be warned but nice and good portions. There are lots of souvenir shops and your little ones will want everything so go with lots of money! Be aware though you will be taken out by someone swinging a backpack in your face! Walt Disney studios has some excellent rides for all ages. The toy story section is good fun and has family rides which adults and children were loving. The new ratatouille 4d ride was excellent fun, if you go on with little ones hold them tight! Crush Coaster is great fun but not what you expect or see on the adverts. It is very quick so you have been told. The queue for tower of terror is never more than 15 minutes so it's a must. ( another tip for avoiding a long queue on ratatouille is head for the ride about 8pm as most people headed home by this time) another way to characters in a small parade at 1.30 outside the disney junior studios. They have a walk around where you can get autographs and have your picture taken with them. Our little one loved the disney junior studios because whilst waiting for the puppet show to start they get to dance and play with Sofia the first! The Disney village is great place to get something to eat or drink. We ate at planet Hollywood. It was extremely busy and had to wait for a table but the food was nice but again expensive. We also ate at mcdonalds which was so busy it took us 30 minutes to get food. The best part was the firework show over the castle in the disneyland park at 10pm. It was a firework show, lightshow and water show! Absolutely amazing is all I can say! Overall it was very expensive to go and very expensive whilst there but definitely worth every penny. Go in the right frame of mind because everything is geared up to have fun. Can't wait to go back!!",Disneyland_Paris

106756560,5,2011-04-01,United States,"We visited Disneyland and California Adventure on April 28, 29th and 30th. We were there to see my son's middle school band play on Main Street. It was fun for everyone! The lines were much shorter on Thursday and Friday. Saturday was very crowded, but we expected that, since it was the weekend. A very kind Disney employee, actually started talking to my daughter ( age 10) in a long line for the Matterhorn, and then asked if he could move us to the front of the line. What a wonderful suprise! We saw Disney employees picking people to move to the front at most of the crowded rides. The World of Color show is well worth the effort it takes to get a ticket. It was a fantastic show in California adventure that my whole family enjoyed. Our advice is to use the fast pass on crowded rides, and remember that they can be used any time after the earliest printed time on the ticket. Also, remember that lots of Disney characters are on main street before the park opens. The gates typically open about half an hour before the park does, and we all met Mickey there. We had a great time and can't wait to return.",Disneyland_California

Great experience as expect from Disney parks. Some familiar rides but slightly re imagined and some different ones. Quick service eats are reasonable considering you are in a park, but the sit down restaurants are fixed price and expensive.

In Hong Kong the Disneyland park was well laid out, and well maintained. They had many very fun rides, and the entire park was beautiful, like the others I have been to.My wife and I both loved the park and the rides, I think we rode everything at least 1 time, some we did 2 times, we also went into the movies and plays and were still able to leave before they closed. I wanted to stay a bit longer, but the wife wanted to leave. Guess who won ;) The day we went the lines were very short and we got on the rides quickly.

116285192,5,2011-06-01,China,"Hong Kong Disneyland is a fantastic place. Set on tropical Lantau Island, less than an hour from Central, against a backdrop of green mountains, HK Disney is full of the fantasy and fun of all Disney parks, just on a very small scale; at 55 acres, it is half the size of the next smallest  Disneyland . Size aside, it is still pure Disney. HK Disneyland has an Adventure Land, Fantasy Land, Tomorrow Land and Main Street and many of the essential Disney atrractions such as Space Mountain and the Jungle Cruise. Unfortunately, they totally missed the boat, and didn't build a Pirates of the Caribbean ride, which makes no sense when you consider this was planned and built during the heyday of the Johnny Depp franchise. It does have some excellent attractions that some of the other parks don't have such as Festival of the Lion King, an excellent show based on the Broadway musical. The small size of the park and lack of major rides is being rectified with a major expansion over the next 3 years that looks to be pretty amazing. The shows and most attractions are in English or English and Chinese, while one or two shows attractions, like the Golden Mickeys are just in Cantonese. All of staff speak English, Cantonese and Mandarin. Service is good and the food is decent. For a vegetarian, such as me, there are more choices than at Tokyo Disneyland, but it's be nice if they had a veggie burger. Both hotels are very good, but very expensive, even for Hong Kong. Public transportation is very convenient as it is connected to Hong Kong's MTR at Sunny Bay, where you get on a Disney themed train with Mickey shaped windows. There are also buses and a ferry port.If you have never been to another Disney park, you might feel this is one of the most amazing places, ever. However, if you have been to any other Disney park, you might be a bit disappointed by how small it is, but get over it, it's still awesome.",Disneyland_HongKong
147671226,1,2012-12-01,Indonesia,"Brought my whole family, kids, brother, nephews and niece to HKD land on Dec 17, 2012. Was my 3rd visit to the park. Off from Indonesia  a 5 hour sky distance from HK  we were all geared up for a full day of fun. Kids were looking forward to it, a full pay off after midterm exams. That morning, we came early with loads of kids' neccessities and my personal photographic gears. Kids' stuff included raincoats, spare clothes  as it was pedicted there would be light showers and for getting prepared for some wet actions. My personal photographic gears included those heavy full frame DSLR body and lenses  as my visit to the park wouldn't be complete without taking some great shots of my family with famous backgrounds such as Disneyland.I packed all those gears in one plane cabin sized roller bag, thinking that it would be too heavy to carry around. What an unpleasant surprise I received from the gate attendant that morning, instructing that I should take out all the heavy gears and leave the roller bag at the deposit counter outside the park at HKD 60 fee. It wasn't the fee that made me upset, but the fact that they commanded me to carry the heavy loads without a roller bag. They even said:  You could take turn carrying them since you have 10 people with you!  What a statement! I thought to myself:  Doesn't she see half of my group consists of children? What a thoughtless statement to have small children carrying heavy loads around while they should have fun riding and enjoying the park's variety of treats and snack? What disappointed me was that there was no precaution whatsoever made to me prior to my coming  whether on the website or at the tickets agency that visitors should NOT bring any roller bags into the park. I ended up carrying all the heavy loads around on my back. Imagine bringing those around for 11 straight hours! I could not enjoy one bit of my visit to HK Disneyland this time, even though still trying hard to take good pictures. We went back home with my back hurt. It was such a hurtful treat from the staff at Disneyland having such a mindless service to visitors like us. I do not know the rationale behind this rule. I could only guess  it could be for security purposes, or commercial purposes. The latter being to stop visitors for not spending to purchase foods offerred from inside the park, if they bring ones from outside.I do not know exactly their reasons, but one thing that had left me with after visiting the theme park, and that is being hurt and disappointed. For those with similar case with me, I suggest they call in first or better still, do not carry heavy loads into the park. You never know what they will surprise you upfront, when they should surprise us during the park experience with great times!",Disneyland_HongKong

They gave us a fast pass to use it later in the day. It was never repaired. Sleeping Beauty Castle was closed off because they were filming Americas Funniest Home Videos. The Matterhorn was still being repaired since January. We complained about our Indiana Jones experience specifically as we knew it would be closed for repairs starting on Monday (we went on the Friday before). The cast member said she can give us a fast pass for indiana jones for the next time we come to the park as compensation. I thought this was a joke and we were on Americas Funniest Home Videos. I told her it could be 10 years if ever we return to Disneyland as we frequent Disney World. Her answer to that was no problem, it will still be valid 10 years later. She had absolutely no customer service skills or a functioning brain. Skip this park and go to Universal Studios when in California.

Basically if you've been to any half decent theme park anywhere in the world, it'll have more to do and have better rides than HK Disneyland. Yes it's very pretty, but i was expecting a much better attention to detail and at least something for small children to do. The day started by us being told off by a member of staff because our 2 year old was having a drink of water on the train (it was a hot day), and went downhill from there.It is incredibly small, we went when it was supposedly quiet, I'd hate to see it when it was busy. It might be better for older children but there's still only about 6 rides so save your money and spend the day looking at amazing Hong Kong and take the kids somewhere better when you get home.

My first Disney experience was in Florida and it was incredibly sunny and warm, and I loved it. This was not the case here in France. It was a little chilly and pretty cloudy, but at least we expected the weather to be this way and prepared for rain (and we refused to let this deter us from having a good time)! The lines weren't crowded, and the staff were friendly. Of all the rides and sights Disneyland Paris has to offer, the most beautiful is Sleeping Beauty's castle. I must have taken 50 pictures of it. We covered the entire classical park in a day and went on many rides from Space Mountain to Pirates of the Caribbean. After watching a wonderful afternoon parade performance by the Disney characters and resembling the small children with the excitement on our faces, we made a dash for the cr  pe and waffle shop. I had a delicious nutella cr  pe, and I even finished off my friend's waffle. Very satisfying!

This was our fourth visit over the last 10 years. Thought Monday would be good as less crowds but in fact the delays were still long. For some reason the little train that took you around the special effects had 2 empty carriages every trip despite a log queue of people waiting. Pity because its a great ride. On previous visits we saw Mickey Mouses etc walking around but this time only Minnie doing a photoshoot   if you wanted to wait 15 mins. Also a good number of food places were closed. The bakery that was open (food excellent) had an outside window with a queue on a very hot day and a queue inside at one counter but another unmanned counter which was being topped up with freshly baked food but no one could buy it ! In 20mins I saw 15 or so people wait at the counter but give up and go away. Assuming they might on average spend 4 euros, that is a lot of lost income.The parade of Disney characters at 5 30pm was great but overall the 2 parks seemed a bit jaded   needs some magic back.

We always enjoy our time here, our latest trip was without children and we took things easy since we've been on all the rides a few times over each. Disneyland is our Vegas, truly. However, we noticed that at times it seemed overly crowded, as in shoulder to shoulder with other humans continuously crowded. It became overwhelming at times, not to mention unnerving. I believe Disney may need to start capping attendance   at times it didn't feel safe and that's not the Disney we have come to love. One of the days we were there we literally were able to get onto FIVE rides, FIVE (and we had a Hopper pass!), it was just so busy. By them being greedy and packing people into the park it really detracts from the enjoyment (and safety) of it. Turning the most magical place on earth into a scary stressful chore of an experience   That's a bit sad to be honest. At early entry we saw people forcibly push others out of the way as they ran towards the rides   it was shameful. Families running dragging their sleepy kids to rides so that they wouldn't have to wait in 75 minute lineups with them later.

Years ago, that wasn't the case. If you were handicapped, you were able to enter a ride via the exit to that ride and your wait was minimal. Shame on you, Disneyland! With more and more Baby Boomers reaching an age where they can no longer keep up with the youngsters of today, you should be more compassionate. Get rid of the fast pass (quit worrying about making an extra buck; my God you already charge an outrageous fee to enter the park) and pretend it's your grandmother standing in line.",Disneyland_California

I found the option of the 'mini 2 park day ticket' on their website, which are available on certain days of the year. They were much less expensive than usual tickets at only around    47 per ticket and cover both the Disneyland and Disney Studios parks. I'd really recommend both choosing this option and going at this time of year, we waited no longer than 10 minutes for any ride and visiting in late November means that 'Christmas' has started at the park but the crowds this draws in December haven't descended upon the park just yet.The atmosphere was as always wonderful and even better with the addition of the Christmas decorations and fake snow. Main attractions to visit:Teenagers adults: Space Mountain (terrifying), Indiana Jones, Big Thunder Mountain (unfortunately under construction at the mo!)Kids Families: Pirates of the Caribbean, Peter Pan, Buzz Light Year Lazer Blast (also closed for maintenance atm) Also highly recommend watching the parade   really great show and a lot of fun!",Disneyland_Paris

The one in HK is a small, compressed version of the Disney experience. But of course, it's always fun to feel the tingling, giddy, magical butterflies in your stomach that only a Disneyland franchise can bring out. It's not the biggest one out there but if your are from the ASEAN region, it's the next best thing. But if you have the means to go to the ones in the Western side, go for that one.

Cars Land had just opened so it was really the only area of either park that was jammed with people. We did have some waits for other rides that were around 60 minutes or so but the lines always felt like they were moving.After stopping at a couple of six flags parks on our way down to Disneyland it became even more apparent why Disney is the amusement park king   everything is so much cleaner and a whole lot more organized.",Disneyland_California

It wasn't chaotic at all. People still strolling and looking around. Staff did I not really physically chase customer out. We quickly redeem our meal voucher and make our way out. Along the way we asked the staff and was told to keep the tickets as we can come back within 6 months with the same ticket. And so we did, on the next day afternoon, as the Typhoon came and left within a night. It was a good decision by my wife as the park is almost empty. We get to sit most of the rides without queue.

Snacks and food were expensive but you're paying for an experience as a whole.

In November Small World is all decked out for Christmas with the dolls singing Jingle Bells instead of the usually song. There are rides here you won't find in Disneyworld and this park is smaller so you can do it all in 1 or 2 days.

I finally got to go there, last time I was there they were just building it. Anyways, the downfall to Disneyland is the food. Not too great, Six Flags' is better. Their corn dogs were terrible. But on the upside you can bring your own food in so that is a plus. Bippity Bop Botique was amazing, my daughter was made over as a princess then we got to meet the princesses. I cried. The Jedi Training was awesome. My son was pulled out of the crowd and got to fight Darth Maul. You can make your own light saber's in the store in tomorrowland, totally worth it.

543609341,5,2017-11-01,United States,"Disneyland is a place to visit that is as good as it gets. I told my husband that we can learn a lesson from humanity by going to Disneyland. You wait in long lines, walk through crowds, wait a long time to get food and drinks during busy periods, you tote children around of all ages, and you do it with patience and a smile, because you're at Disneyland. And  nothing bad happens at Disneyland.  I saw people with screaming babies, and they handled it in stride. At the end of the day, Dads and Moms alike were carrying toddlers through the park, waiting for their bus ride back to the hotel, exhausted beyond words, but they smiled and waited patiently. They could have been grumpy, but they were not. After all, we had just spent the day at the Magic Kingdom.

624684421,3,2018-10-01,United States,"When it comes to Disneyland, there are three types of people. The people who love Disney, no matter what their age. The people who are doing the obligatory  taking the kids trip,  and the people who are never going. That being said, anyone who is reading reviews isn't doing so to decided whether or not to go, they're reading it for the tips. I fall into the second to third category of people but am happy to share my recent experience to make someone else's better. We went for 2 days with the husbands kids and grandkids here are a couple of pointers and things I found.First, download the Disneyland App and also pay the extra (I think it was $40 for the hubs and I for 2 days) for the Max Pass. This allows you to do multiple things. First, you can book Fast Passes from your phone rather than having to walk to the ride and then come back at a certain time. Also, it allows you to have multiple Fast Passes at a time and let's you know when you are eligible to book your next one. Other cool features are that it let's you connect and keep all of your pictures in one place, let's you book food or restaurant reservations, gives you wait times for all of the rides for both Disney and California Adventure and tells you where characters are appearing and at what times. You can also keep you tickets on your phone so you don't have to worry about paper tickets. Honestly, the app was the biggest 'Hidden Gem' of the park. We were there on a Sunday and Monday and it was packed. It didn't help that it was Gay Pride, Canadian Thanksgiving and Columbus day all at the same time. As a result, the park was at max capacity both days. What I found helpful was starting about a week before, check the app and note the popular rides. When you first get into the park, go straight to one of them and then start Fastpassing a second a third. Due to the amount of people in the park, this was the only way we got to do the rides we wanted. Also, I would say 8 12 is your best opportunity to wait in the shortest lines. By noon both days, Fastpasses were 'sold out' and lines were 1 2 hours long. Even trying to get pictures with characters was 1 2 1 hour long wait times.Don't take kids younger than 6! We were there with a 3 and 5 year old and it seemed overwhelming for them and like they didn't quite get it. They weren't super into the rides (if at all) So it was a lot of eating a shopping and doing smaller things. It's a lot of money to pay for the kids not to get the full experience. Not saying all kids will be like this but in general, it seemed that way for the younger ones. Pack the least amount of stuff with you as possible. Hubs and I didn't even take bags in. Just phones, and sunglasses. He wore cargo pants to carry Id's a CC's and I wore cheap sunglasses so I wouldn't have to worry about them getting damaged or lost. This helped for getting through security and also with rides and the amount of people. Less is more. If you have kids and need to take bags etc, just take the minimum of what you need. The one item I recommend, especially if you are using the app is an extra battery charger and cord. I have a $30 Anker charger I got from Amazon that gives your phone about 5 charges and is pretty small to pack. You will be taking pics and using your phone with the app so you'll want to keep it charged. Disney has a few Kiosks where you can rent a charger but it was about $30 of a charge. Do yourself a favor and bring your own. Plan on dropping some coin, especially if you have kids. Disney ears alone were $30 a piece and I don't think we had a meal that was less than $30 for 2 people and we are just talking sandwiches and chips. The balloons were $15 plus each and with a couple of kids it adds up fast. Last year, the hubs and I did a three week Europe trip and spent $2500 total and we could have easily spent more than that for a few days in Disney. Go in knowing everything is expensive and make a budget of what you are and are not willing to pay for. Finally, stay off the property. We stayed about a 10 minute walk away but some other family members opted to stay at the Disneyland Grand Hotel. While the location is great, you are basically paying $600 plus a night to shorten your walk and maybe get a few other things (that you have to pay extra for). For example, my husbands daughter paid to have the room decorated. It was cool because it looked like Mickey had been there and the kids got a few keepsakes but other than that it was a basic double hotel room with about a 5 minute shorter walk to the entrance of the park. For us, staying a 10 minute walk away, we saved several thousand dollars got away from the crowds for a bit and got breakfast with our room which saved us from spending breakfast money in the park. The last time I was in Disney was 2000 and I remember it being far more fun and magical. To me it seems like an over priced and over crowded tourist trap but also if you have kids or grand kids, a necessary evil at least once. At this point I can say it's been checked off my bucket list and I don't need to go back.

I'm sure it's a great option for people that can not travel to the  real  Disney parks, but if you've ever been to one of those parks before, there is not way that you can compare those to Disneyland Paris.The park workers are generally disinterested and acted only partially willing to help when you had a question. (And yes, we asked in French and conversed in French as much as possible.) The park wasn't as clean as other Disney parks. People smoked everywhere, which was really unpleasant for non smokers.It was virtually impossible to find anything healthy to eat. At Disney World, you can find all sorts of salads, fresh cut fruit, whole fruit etc at the restaurants and stands throughout the park. We couldn't find anything like this while we were there. We resorted to pizza, after waiting outside of Hakuna Matata for an hour and a half past the supposed opening time...guess opening times were just a suggestion.There were SO many people who got in line without everyone in their group and then the rest of the group would push their way through to meet up the people who were furthest ahead in the line. That was quite annoying.The prices were high, of course. That's one thing that all Disney parks have in common! We enjoyed the traditional Disney rides and there were some different rides or attractions that were nice to see that were a change from the US parks. Overall, we had a nice enough day, but it just can't hold a candle to its US counterpart. Disneyland Paris was definitely missing the wow factor that you come to expect from Disney.

We watched the fireworks from New Orleans Square, facing the riverboat and Thunder Mountain. We had a great view and a special treat to see the dancing water show and the cinnamon scented snowflakes falling at the end. Renting a locker was worth the $10 but you have to do it early in the day or it will sell out. Stay hydrated, bring snacks and a jacket because it does get chilly at night this time of year.

Having family in California, every once in a while I chose to visit Disneyland. It is always overcrowded and packed with strollers that seem to always find my ankles and the back of my leg. I took my three grandchildren last week, the visit was a delight. It was crowded but not crazy busy. We visited on a Thursday. There were plenty of lockers to store our sweaters and purchases. Best part of the day was discovering the Disneyland app and purchasing the 10.00 fast pass addition to our tickets. Not once did we wait more than 15 minutes for a ride. I was also able to view wait times on rides so I could choose which rides to just walk on and which to get a fast pass for. This app is a MUST. I also recommend paying the extra 15.00 for parking on the main Micky and Friends garage so you can park next to the escalators and elevators.

So you should make plans carefully to take advantage of the dayPark closes at 9 pm and there are special activities every day. fYou should be aware on them in order to take advantage.We finished watching the Show on the Bay, a wonderful one with color, water and fire Very easy to leave and find your route back to your hotel or transportationSafety is really excellent all over the installation",Disneyland_California
463123114,4,2016-03-01,United States,"Went here by train took a while as the travel system isn't the easiest. Went off season so not everything was open. Rides were amazing. Aerosmith ride, studios for both parks. Cinderellas castle was amazing. Stayed in the park til 9.30pm to stay and watch the fireworks and pyrotechnics on the castle. Only issue is the gift shop, mainly consisted of trashy things newly released, not much classic Disney at all. Restaurants were severely overpriced, however it was nice food. Would I return... yes I would. It was a very nostalgic experience.",Disneyland_Paris

396600281,4,2016-07-01,United Kingdom,"Just returned from a visit to Disney and overall it was pretty good. As mentioned by a few other reviewers a number of rides where shut   most notably thunder mountain however there was more than enough for my three kids to busy themselves with. I was surprised to read a few reviews that criticised the food, I've been to Disney Orlando and the food at Paris was a different league. Good restaurants with table service, varied choice rather than the fast food with yellow cheese options over the pond and most notably decent wine and beer available at most eateries. Disney goes much better after a half bottle of wine (Magic Kingdom Orlando   take note!!)We found the staff very helpful and my children enjoyed listening to the traditional Disney offerings in a variety of languages. It was a bit busy trying to meet the characters but if you time it well it is not a problem.The longest we had to wait for a ride was Crush's Coaster (no fast pass available ) and that was about 40 minutes. When you consider that we visited during the busiest weeks for France (including Bastille Day) I didn't think that was too bad. We stayed in one of the Disney hotels which meant we got in the park early (note this only works for the one park   Disneyland Paris   not Disney studios) and I recommend this as it lets you grab the busy rides before the big crowds arrive. Also if you want to go on the train   try and pick it up and one of the stations dotted around the park   not at the entrance as this is the busiest station.My only complaint   but it is a biggie   concerned the show Mickey the Magician. If you are going with young children please be careful. We had to wait for nearly an hour to get into the theatre because apparently it is a new show. This was not a problem in itself but unlike the rest of Disney the queue is not managed by the  weaving fence  system that is usually in place. Rather hundreds of people are in one holding area awaiting the only door to the theatre to open. When it did there was a mass rush and press of humanity determined to get in to get the best seats. My twins are only seven and were in real danger of being trampled as people pushed to get in. Disney need to organise the queuing better at this venue or there will be an incident.That aside the rest of the visit was good and my children had a wonderful time and after all it is about them and for them. Crush's coaster was their highlight while my wife and I preferred the equally good but slightly less nausea inducing ratatouille ride!!",Disneyland_Paris
130437873,5,2012-05-01,United States,"I think Disney does a great job of protecting some Nostalgic, memorable parts of the park while moving forward. I feel I can always count on them to put quality behind everything they do. Over the last several years, they've done a great job of improving the quality of the food they offer in the park. The addition of Fast Passes to the most popular rides means you don't spend your entire day standing in line. My advice to new visitors is to take time to appreciate everything the park has to offer beyond the fantastic rides. The best way to enjoy your day is to pace yourself, enjoy the bands and singers that are stationed throughout the park, and let it be ok if you don't get to do everything. Disneyland isn't just any old theme park, there's so much to take in and enjoy, you miss a lot if you just rush from ride to ride.",Disneyland_California

434742027,4,2016-10-01,Canada,"This was my first time going to HK Disneyland and my first time going to any Disney park as an adult, but it made no difference because it was Disney!We came on a Tuesday, the day after a long weekend, and it was wonderful. Busy enough that we didn't want to line up to take photos with the characters, but quiet enough that we only needed to line up at most for 5 minutes for a ride. Some rides we went on more than once just because we could and the lack of line ups made it worth the time.The prices in the shops were what you expected   expensive. The food was surprisingly good. Expensive as any food would be in a theme park, but it wasn't bland like I expected. My husband who went nearly ten years ago (as a young adult, ha) was not as impressed. He enjoyed it very much still, but did comment on how the staff did not look as happy and energetic (by Disney standards) and that it looked a bit rundown, compared to before and what you would expect from the Disney business. For examples, paint was chipping off on a few of the rides and the mannequins in the shops were not in good condition (one had all but his middle finger broken off). For the price you pay, you would expect more in its maintenance. We went on must of the rides and spent a good amount of time in the shops, and were walking out just after 4 hours. We may consider coming back when we have kids, but would be willing to splurge a little more for another Disney location if the upkeep is better there.",Disneyland_HongKong

Day visits to the park proved frustrating with long hot waits and very little actual riding. Night time was the right time, returning after 7 allowed us to get on more rides with shorter waits.

Food is pretty rubbish and picnics are not permitted but it is easy to smuggle in a few snacks, (I think they are trying to stop people from laying out banquets on the grass).Make sure to catch at least one fireworks display and one parade as they really are very, very good.The Disney app will inform about queue times. We found some of the ride queue times shown at the entrances to be quite inaccurate.There is more than you can ever imagine to see and do. Children will want a notebook to collect autographs from the characters. Adults will need a well charged camera.Fab time.

617772316,5,2018-08-01,United Kingdom,A magical wonderful place to visit and wish we could go again as there is still much to see. We only visited Monday to Friday and needed to fit in as much as we could so very tired at the end of the week.Spent most of our time in Disneyland Park as it is larger but did spend a day at the studios where we saw the Mickey Sorcerers Apprentice show and the Stunt Cars and both were brilliant. There are rides to suit everyone in Disneyland Park although there are numerous shops selling merchandise. This makes it feel like they are always trying to sell to you. We would still like to visit again and feel that there is something for everyone. Best to make sure you have entrance tickets included in your hotel package as day tickets can be expensive on their own.The carnival is amazing but the illiuminations and fireworks get extremely busy and hard to see unless you arrive early and stand at the front.Hope that we can afford to go again someday. If you don't have the finances to enter the parks the Disney village is free to enter and has many shops and bars to enjoy. It's magical and it all started with a mouse !,Disneyland_Paris

The rides are more family oriented thus it will not be as thrilling as universal studio's rides.This is my 2nd time to HK Disneyland. It was crowded when it was first opened and it was understandable. This time round, I went on a Monday, not expecting any crowd during the off peak period but I had to wait up to 30 to 45 mins for many rides. i also had many terrible experiences in the Disneyland as the tourists were really very rude. They nudge and bump into people inconsiderately, holding no reins on their children who modeled the adults' behaviours. The worst of all, is when tourists came up to the shopping basket that I am holding, to shop for the things that they want to get from my selections. No, I was not dressed up like any Mickey Mouse or anyone alike to the Disneyland staff to warrant for such rudeness.I would say that Disneyland is still a great place for families and kids but my advice to interested tourists is to avoid peak holiday period as the experience of the company whom you hang out with in the place of interest makes a huge impact to your traveling memory.",Disneyland_HongKong
121183226,4,2011-04-01,Philippines,"We truly enjoyed our visit to Hong Kong Disneyland. Just walking towards the park from the shuttle parking area made us excited to be a step closer to the happiest place on earth! Though it was quite a walk, we were so glad to finally see the park gates and we posed for souvenir shots along the way. There was no queue at the entrance so we just presented our tickets and we were off. After the awhile, our small group got separated inside the park and it was kinda hard to find each other again in the growing afternoon crowd. Anyway, we found each other at some point so its best to agree on a meeting site beforehand in case someone in your party gets lost. We enjoyed the Space Mountain ride, the Small World boat ride, the train ride (with the little green men paparazzi!) and the interactive shooting game ride with Buzz Lightyear. We also enjoyed the Stitch encounter, 3D movie at the theater and the fun filled night time river boat ride! If Hong Kong DIsneyland, the smallest Disneyland theme park as they say, was this uber fun, my kids and I can just imagine how much more fun it would be to spend a day in the much bigger DIsneyland parks in the USA! What I really like about the park is the picture shooting spots that they placed all over the park so you can see which are the most perfect picture spots. I also like how clean and well kept the park is. There is much space to move around even with the hordes of tourists on the move. The fireworks display was indeed a fitting finale to a very wonderful evening!Just be prepared to spend for food and drinks   you'll get hungry from all the excitement!

We queued for a Thunder Mountain for nearly 2.5 hours despite the sign saying 70 minutes. The place was freezing with not a single heater anywhere. The food prices make the cinemas look like a charity   12 euro for two messily boxes of popcorn.The place does look amazing and the rides (if you can get on them) are fabulous but the votes are in and we won't be going back.

190140238,4,2014-01-01,United Kingdom,"very shocked at reading some of the previous reviews as we felt the Christmas spirit was great and the decorations were amazing! however it was our 1st time here so maybe its been better previous?we visited on friday 3rd jan. didn't arrive till midday as we were so tired from travelling the day before and well wish we would of gone when the park opened as it was SO busy and ques for all ride were 40 mins to 2 hours. (hard work with a 2 year old). We literally were able to go on a handful of rides but go so fed up of french locals (the ones that beg for money in paris) pushing there way through ques. So unfair really think Disney should have staff manning some ques as this was unacceptable. They stand in the que, push there child through to another part under the ropes and then walk up the que past people pointing at the child as if ton say they are with them. quite a few people noticed what was going on as well as us and confronted them but they just laughed and were SO rude it was shocking. so be aware of this and always move up and leave no spaces as they really do take the p*** out of people doing this!the walk into disney was lovely the decorations were fab and main st USA looked magical. as soon as we got in the park we heard the parade was 10 mins so we stuck around and got a front kerb space. the parade was amazing, although a little short only about 3 floats   mickey,minnie and pluto, toy story, donald duck and santa with character in between. We were very happy to have watched it though but we were expecting it to be much longer after watching disney parades prior to visit on youtube. the weather was good and wasn't too cold so that was a bonus for us.we ate at the golden nugget which is a non reservation restaurant   you Que you go in order pay then are seated and food is with you withing mins. they do set meals (burger chips drink and dessert) for about 14 euros which is good. the meal was good, better than usual fast food and you got good portion sizes. I know alot of people complain about the price of food but we though this was quite good and c'mon your in disney what do you expect?! there were other restaurants we went to before but were fully booked (a steakhouse I cant remember the actual name) and there is also cheaper options too but this was ideal for us to have a bit of timeout and a recharge. there was a band playing and the atmosphere was nice.one thing we missed were the programmes as you enter the park that tell you where the characters will be at set times, our little girl REALLY wanted to see Minnie but we just couldn't find her. we left after 6 as our LO was so tired and did well to stay awake all day so we missed the fireworks as they weren't until 10.Realistically you do need 2 days here and it is better to stay at disney so you can get in early and if you stay at a disney hotel you get extra park hours.the Disney village was lovely and we really wished we stayed there as it was much nicer than staying in paris itself.you do need alot of money but i guess you could take a packed lunch and do it on a budget, my advice would be to to take extra money eat there and do the whole experience as seating was few and far between. the gift shops were great and we went a little overboard but again, its unlikely we will come back for a long time so you may as well get what you want.the staff we found were good and not too grumpy but one thing that that I wasn't happy with was when we were choosing some gloves for our daughter, the lady was in such a rush to get the money in the till, (there was nobody else to be served) I had asked her to wait for a moment as i needed to find the size and whilst we were going round the stall looking she told my partner we had got the size so he paid for the items and then when I said to her we don't want the gloves they are way too big (which she must of known as our daughter is 2 and they only come in sizes 7 10) she couldn't process a refund and we had to walk out of our way to a completely different shop to get it authorised.overall a good day but go early and on a weekday. cant imagine what the ques are like weekends!",Disneyland_Paris

However, Disneyland has 1 major flaw, which becomes quite evident in the first 2 hours there. Disneyland has a severe shortage of restrooms. It is baffling that a company as sophisticated as Disneyland did not account for sufficient restroom capacity inside its iconic park! For men, it's better. But for women who want to use restroom, forget about it! The line for women restroom is so long for every restroom in Disneyland park. Shameful for whoever is in charge of this at Disneyland park.

I have a Go Pro with the official 3 way tripod stick which I had to remove and throw away. I had the option to return this to my hotel, but as my walk to the park already took 35mins I didn't want to waste anymore time. There are no lockers available pre security so if there is something you are not allowed to take in you are faced with a difficult decision, either dispose of it or waste part of your day returning it to your hotel or car. Fair enough you can check the rules and terms and conditions before turning up, which I would advise if you have any sort of large luggage or camera equipment. The park was fairly busy and we visited on a Wednesday, I would avoid the weekends or school holidays. I would recommending using the free Fast Pass service for the most popular rides or you will have long queue's. Ask the Guest Services about where the characters will be this will save you time looking around for them. The Photo Pass that they offer for $78 is really good value you get digital downloads of all of the photos taken throughout the day including ride photos, which is really good. Many rides were closed for refurbishment but that didn't stop us from having a great day. The corn on the cob's are really tasty. ",Disneyland_California
156588375,5,2013-03-01,Ireland,"The layout of the park is great. Having pored over the map before travelling we though we'd be walking for miles, however it's all very neatly laid out.There's a lot to do and see in the park, even though it's not all sprawled out. The rides aren't really for thrill seekers but if you're young at heart, it's still nice to see the beautiful Sleeping Beauty's Castle, the carousel, meet Mickey Mouse and go on a number of the train and boat rides where you can see the scenes from the classic Disney cartoons. The paint jobs are well maintained on the buildings and the gardens perfectly groomed. Every little prop tells a story and the little kids loved that.The Studios park is not too far away if you want to go between parks and catch different shows. The Disney Dreams closing light show is on until October 2013 and we're delighted we caught it on time. It's magnificent and a real for treat adults and children alike. Plenty of Disney and non Disney accommodation nearby and transportation is adequate.Even in March, though it was very cold this year, there were plenty of rides with 45 mins waiting times. Try not to walk the park  in order  from the morning, break it up a little and hopefully you'll miss the rush and peak times.Make sure you take advantage of the Fastpass and get one early on. On a busy afternoon you could be looking at waiting until evening for your allotted time. Many rides become quiet half hour before closing with waiting times of 5mins. Recommended  thrill  rides: rock 'n' Rollercoaster, RC Racer and Tower of Terror.Cons: We couldn't figure out where the bag storage has been moved to as the lockers are now disabled. The food is mostly junk food and a lot of it is very expensive. The bathrooms, while pretty on the outside are very very smelly and quite old looking on the inside.",Disneyland_Paris

Silver pass cost $850HKD (access every week day and some weekends)10) You can buy a single or double entry ticket for $450 or $650 and Enjoy entry to the park any day. or buy an Annual pass of higher value and have access to the park on weekends.11) Fast passes have been removed from the Buzz Light Year Ride12) Fast pass still available for Winie the Phoo and Space mountain. However Space mountain Single rider's line is very quick as well.I Don't want to end my post on Disney on a low note so I am going to say that the following problem may have nothing to do with Disney itself:I think there is an issue with PhotoPass, but probably it is not related to Disney itself, as it may be a contracting company working for them. When you get photos taken at the park you are offered to purchase a digital copy that can be downloaded from Disneyphotopass.com.hk We purchased a bunch of digital downloads but didn't know that photos are available only for 2 weeks. our trip was longer than 2 weeks and when we returned home and tried to download the photos they were all deleted. Contacted Disneyphotopass and was told Tough Luck.In a previous trip, we paid for the same service from Universal Studios and Lego Land in Singapore, and the photos are still available for download (after nearly 5months).Disney would you please look into this? ... customer who pay for something and get nothing feel like they have been robbed.I Love Disney parks ... all of them ...

It might not wow you if you've been to Florida, California or Paris but if its your first time and you like Disney then definitely go! The rides are pretty good, of course there's no huge roller coasters as it still has to be child friendly. Toy story land is worth a visit itself, the detail that goes into Disney never disappoints!!

To be honest though you are better off eating elsewhere as it   s a bun fight with hundreds of people handling and poking the food your expected to eat.The hotel is a nice walk from the park along the canal and saves the scramble for the bus.With the exception of the hotel, service and politeness seem to have been abandoned completely. It would seem delivery of cold food is the norm across most of the restaurants with Annette   s diner being the worst offender. If you want a cold breakfast with poor service go there. Even McDonalds have managed to take the    fast    out of fast food as one of the slowest ever experienced.The rides are now getting tired and the fast pass system is in the dark ages, they could benefit from a system like Florida with the wristband for entry and for fast passes. However you would need reliable Wi Fi for that which is not the case here it   s dreadful with constant drops the app freezes and very slow and this is across a range of up to date phones on iOS and Android. Wi Fi needs attention it can   t seem to cope with the load placed on it.It   s still a joy to watch the kids faces when they meet their favorite superhero or when they get on a ride the anticipation is real.

133845903,4,2012-07-01,Philippines,"A must see attraction on your first trip to Hong Kong.To make sure it's sweet and short, here are tips for you:  1 whole day is definitely enough to explore the magical place     Make sure it's a sunny day on your visit as I've been told parades are canceled when it's pouring.  Yes, it's a sunny day which means an umbrella should be brought for the walks from one magical ride to another.  As soon as you enter the area, get a map and plan your route as you don't want to miss meeting all those wonderful Disney characters during parades. There are 2 parades: 12nn HKT and 4pm HKT.  Fireworks display starts at 9PM HKT. Make sure you get a good spot in front as besides the fireworks, they also have a slideshow projected on the walls of Sleeping Beauty's castle which you won't see if you're at the back.  Food is expensive (At least for me, after converting price to local currency   PHP, I wanted to eat even the plate) ! They have 2 food courts which offer different cuisines. Asian (noodles and rice meals) and American ( fried chicken and burgers). They have food stands too which offer ice creams, pop corns, hotdogs, etc. The two piece fried chicken with rice and coke I ate for lunch costs 88HKD if I remember it right. Price range of meals are from 70HKD 100HKD. Food portion is good for 1 regular person with regular appetite. Haha! They do not serve hot sauce, only sweet chili sauce.  Food cannot be brought in so if you are on a budget you can save by buying 1 big bottle of water drink inside then keep the bottle as there are water fountains in the area. One can be found near Buzz Lightyear's area   before you enter the restrooms. One bottle of 12ml of orange juice costs 26HKD, but it really tasted good.  Hated the It's a Small World attraction. It's just 10 20 minutes but I don't see anything Disney about it. It's just all dolls, some of which, creeped me out. Looked like a ride from a very rusty carnival ride.

307979631,3,2015-03-01,Costa Rica,I visited this park in the 1960's and took my daughter here in the spring for 2 days. We had a really good time. There were a few rides shut down and we were a bit disappointed but we didn't let it deter us from enjoying our visit. I scouted the internet for discounted park tickets and found none. Don't waste your time. Fairly pricey. Souvenirs were pricey as well as food. We opened and closed the park. The firework show is good but since I produce fireworks shows my daughter and I took advantage of that time to get on popular rides fast. I'd suggest doing this if you only have a day or two to visit the park.  The Disney parade is very entertaining even for a fifty year old. I'll never forget the look on my 13 year old daughters face during the parade. She was a little girl all over again which was worth the price of admission. All in all the two of us had a great time.

There are rides for all ages (our 3 year old son was never bored) and our 7 year old could go on most rides too. The Parade and lights firework shows were good and the mid day mini parades were fun.

Parents of young riders should be aware that the Haunted Mansion and Big Thunder Mountain rides have a lot of time in the dark compared to WDW. The parks are a little smaller than WDW and easier to navigate.I guess we are spoiled by the cleanliness of WDW as we were a little disappointed to find litter and weeds in the landscaping and on the walkways from the Disney hotels to the Disney Village.

Space Mountain was closed down for an entire day. California Adventure is undergoing a major renovation   half the park is under construction and new attractions are coming in 2012. The World of Color is amazing and well worth the wait to see. Be aware that there are no seats for this show   you will be standing for the entire show.

464761511,3,2017-03-01,United States,"I've been to Disney World multiple times and it's always been a great experience. We decided this time we wanted to try Disneyland. I have to say I was very disappointed with the experience. Everyone knows Disney isn't cheap but most people are ok paying because you know you're going to get a great experience, or so we thought. My first complaint would be the number of rides that were closed during our visit. Most people make plans for a trip to Disney months in advance but Disney will often release ride closures on very short notice. We knew about part of the park being closed while they work on Star Wars land and were ok with that. I assumed that meant that the other rides would be open. I was very disappointed to see just in the last couple weeks that in addition to the closures for Star Wars construction the Pirates of the Caribbean and Matterhorn Bobsleds would be closed as well. This was especially aggravating as these were the 2 rides that were different than Disney World that we wanted to experience. In addition to the ride closures we also experienced multiple unexpected temporary ride closures. We were in line 3 times where the ride broke down and they had to shut the rides down temporarily. Even the monorail was broken when we tried to ride that. The crowds were also a problem. We went during what was expected to be one of the slowest weeks of the year for the park and it was still quite crowded. Lines were often long for the attractions. I can't imagine coming here during peak season.Perhaps we were lucky on our previous trips to Disney World but we never experienced these problems before and again when you are paying Disney prices you expect a better quality. In the future we'll be sticking to the Florida parks.",Disneyland_California
471893804,5,2017-03-01,Canada,"We went during spring break and it was busy but never stood in line for more than 40 min. Disneyland is the master of lines keeping you entertained while making them look small.The three things you will NEED is the park hopper pass, Disneyland app and your phone with data. The app show closed attractions, washrooms, length of lines, fast pass times and where and when Characters can be found. Fast passes will ensure you do not spend your vacation standing in lines. We had our older son who would run ahead and get our fast pass then we would go to the other park and get a fast pass there. Then we would plan our rides based on lineup times until we could use our fast pass and get another. We did 5 days and only had a couple of rides we wanted to do on day 5 and spent allot of the day repeating our favorite ones. We rented strollers for the two little girl's 6 and under. This is a must because you cover a lot of ground in a day. We left all our stuff in the strollers and never had any issues until the last night when someone grabbed the wrong stroller after the fireworks. We got all our stuff back the next morning except 1 souvenir cup ( they throw out any containers that contain or possibly contain liquids). Disneyland did replace the cup free of charge which was fantastic. This trip can be expensive with the dollar exchange but is a must for families. My recommendation would be to take kids when they are between 6 an 10 as they can ride almost any ride and they really appreciated the magic of the park. ",Disneyland_California

120925981,3,2011-11-01,United States,"TOP TIP: For the evening fireworks go to it's a smaal world, it's less crowded you can still hear the music and have a great view of the fireworks (excluding the 3 4 they set off from the castle) and afterwards they make it snow on the crowd. Very magical.You cant beat Disneyland for it's Christmas efforts, re theming rides, decorations, parade, fireworks, it was all very good.Problem   compared to Magic Kingdom at Disney World, and pretty much every park I've ever been to it is very, very, very crowded. I know it's the most visisted park in the world but it doesnt help that the main paths from area to area aren't big enough or if they are are taken up by stroller parking (especially Tomorrowland). The lines weren't too bad, longest wait I did was 40 mins for the roger rabbit ride as i made good use of fastpass, but if you didnt use the fastpass then some rides were 65 70 mins.Food & drink was very expensive even for a theme park.

This is a beautifully landscaped, clean park. The ride lines were short when we were there and we enjoyed riding a couple rides (such as Mystic Manor) that are unique to HK Disneyland. Hong Kong on the whole is a beautiful place, the people are friendly and it is very much  western  friendly with most people speaking English. My only complaint is there could be more quick service restaurants with more  western  food. Trying to find food other than snacks in the park was very challenging.

Even as parents we enjoyed it as well.As the park was designed with Chinese people in mind, you'll find that younger children can go on the more thrilling rides.My 3 year old was talk enough to go on Space Mountain for example. There are some limitations in height and weight, so some of you taller or heavier folk may have challenges.We struggled to find vegetrian food, but the Main Street diner had the widest choice. Although popcorn, fries, etc were available.The park is relatively small, on par with the UK theme parks, so on a quiter dat only on dat is needed.

173372421,4,2013-08-01,United States,"For 18 years we traveled from Northern California to Disneyland two or three times a year. We took two or so years off and then made the decision to go this past week for my husband's birthday. The park is still clean and the landscaping is beautiful once you get in the gates. We had magic mornings because we stayed at a Disney Hotel. This enabled us to ride all the attractions early in the day, get fast passes, and not feel the rush of the crowds. While the magic is still there, the cast members smile a little less, and at times we found they don't know the rules so apply them inconsistently. This is a big change from a few years ago.Getting through the gate can be a hassle unless you have a Season Pass. Multi day passes are scanned first by a person at the outside gate. If your photo matches your pass, you proceed to the turnstile to pass through. Before all of this you must go through the bag check line whether you have a bag or not. Over the years we have suggested a separate line for those without bags to no avail. BUT, no matter, we had a wonderful time. Be prepared to spend money for food, tickets, drinks, etc. or take in your own lunch and snacks. Have fun.",Disneyland_California
225318058,3,,New Zealand,"Had a good day out here but it wasn't fantastic. Great infrastructure and we thoroughly enjoyed the Aerosmith ride, but overall the park is a bit tired. Food was average and junky, nothing healthy was available which was unfortunate. After    24 for a poorer version of McDonalds we felt robbed and slightly worse for wear. Fast pass idea is flawed, we went to space mountain to get a fast pass and the fast pass line looked just as long as the regular line. Defeats the purpose really! Queuing was 90 minutes at the ratatouille ride, and we were informed that fast passes were no longer available, so had to go without. Not sure about the logic here.We did not come across any staff who looked pleased to be at work, except for the dancers in the Main Street USA area. Staff operating the food stalls especially were unhelpful and snooty, which brought down the happy and cheery Disney experience.Thoroughly recommend buying tickets to both parks which we did upon recommendation by our hotel, there is not enough to do in either park alone.

198668807,5,2014-03-01,Canada,"This is our third time going to Disneyland and it was just as enjoyable as our last. We have gone for five full days every time that we visit, and have never ran out of things to do between Disneyland park and the California Adventure Park. Even as my kids have grown into teenagers they still have a lot of fun! Even though it was spring break, the park was much less crowded than we expected and we were able to see everything that we wanted to see! We spent three days in Disneyland, one of those days were a Saturday, and did not have to wait any more than 45 minutes in any of the single lines. My family has some tips for avoiding the line ups and seeing the most that we can (these tips are geared towards family with older children who are more interested in seeing attractions rather than meeting characters): Try to get there before the park officially opens. (I know, it can be difficult but other people find it difficult too and don't end up getting there early.) Main Street opens half an hour before the rest of the park, and you can spend some of the time browsing shops or having a quick bite to eat while waiting).  Once the park officially opens, head towards the most popular attraction that you want to see (some attractions at Disneyland park with the biggest line ups are Indiana Jones, Splash Mountain, Space Mountain, the Matterhorn and Big Thunder Mountain).  After riding the first ride, go to another ride that has the Fast pass system (Fastpass is a great system that is available at a few of the biggest attractions in Disneyland and California Adventure park. All you do is insert your park ticket into the machine by the ride, and it will give you a Fastpass ticket with a time to return to the ride. When you do return, you're admitted into a separate entrance that usually has no more than a 10 15 minute wait, even when the Standby line can be over an hour and a half!) After you get a Fastpass, plan the next things you want to do but make sure your back in time for your Fastpass! The park seems to get busier at about 11 AM, so before then seems to be the best time to usually do the big name attractions. When the park hits it busiest peak, which is usually between 1 AM and 4 PM, use the time to see some of the shows and smaller name attractions. The Golden Horseshoe in Frontierland has 15 minute shows than run every hour in the afternoon, and it is a fun place to grab a snack and get out of the sun for a while. Other show to watch is the Tiki Room in Adventureland (Nice and Air conditioned; they sell pineapple dole whip and floats right outside, and even though the show is getting outdated, we enjoy the air conditioning so much that we still go every time!) Other good options for the afternoon are the Mark Twain Riverboat or the Pirate's Lair in Frontierland as well as Main Street attractions (they have street cars you can ride on and a few shows to see as well. Pirates of the Caribbean and the Haunted Mansion are good as well for the afternoon, because these attractions hold so many people at one time that even if the line is long, it goes really fast. Usually during the early evening the crowds start to slow down again. This is a good time to see some of those attractions you didn't get the chance to see yet. Another tip is that if there is a ride that is always lined up (like the Matterhorn or Space Mountain), you can get in line right before the park closes, and as long as you're in line before then you will still get on. This way, you are not going to feel like you are wasting your entire day waiting for one ride. The line also seems to go much faster after the park closes too. ;) Also, if you want to see Fantasyland, plan to see it either right when you arrive or later in the evening. Stay clear of it in the afternoon! This place is always packed, and since the rides do not hold many people you can be waiting for over 2 hours for some of the attractions. Also, the lines can be tick you. They may not look long, when in reality the wind many times and go through tunnels. So make sure you check the sign at the front of the attraction for the estimated wait time. We were also very pleased with the food selection this time (has improved a lot since the last time we visited). Some of our favourites were the shrimp salad stuffed potato at the Harbor Galley (near Critter Country and New Orleans Square), the Clam Chowder that can be found around the park, and the Hungry Bear Restaurant in Critter Country. If your looking for pizza or pasta, go to Red Rocket's Pizza Port in Tomorrowland. If you want finer dining, try the Blue Bayou. We finally treated ourselves to this restaurant and it became the highlight of our trip. The restaurant sits in the Pirates of the Carribean restaurant, so you get to watch the boats go by as you eat. Also, the food was great and the service was awesome!When travelling with older kids, as long as you remember that Disneyland is not a park for thrill rides, but for it's charm and experience, you will have a great time! I truly believe that Disneyland is for everyone!",Disneyland_California

248652542,5,2014-12-01,United States,We love to go to Disney. We have passes & enjoy going frequently. We went for New Year's Eve to enjoy the band playing at the celebration. If you are experiencing Disney for the first time or with young children during this time specifically the week between Christmas & the new year make sure you have more than one day to enjoy the parks because they are very busy & capacity is frequently reached. If you have a diaper age child remember the Baby Care Center on Main Street for diaper changes so that you can avoid the crowds at the restrooms. If you go during the Christmas holiday & expect these factors you will be able to have as enjoyable of a trip as you would going during a non peak time.,Disneyland_California
201845618,5,2014-04-01,United Kingdom,Fantastic family holiday for a large group which included a baby and older children.We hired a bus to get there which worked well as we could stop at any point. We hired a stunning house in Ebly which was better than we could have expected. Despite the sugar coating I have to say the holiday was fantastic and the park was stunning. The evening light and water show was spectacular and the park was spotlessly clean. Would highly recommend.The only downside was the food. It was unbelievably expensive to buy and much was 'fast food'. Very hard if you are a veggie  take your own food.,Disneyland_Paris
240039621,3,,Singapore,"To be clear, average rating are given from the point of view of 2 adults. Quite limited entertainment for adults apart from the iron man exhibit. The rides are primarily for kids. Tame and mild rides did not excite us.",Disneyland_California
488325887,5,2017-05-01,United States,"What can I say. How can Disneyland not be magical. The look in our boys face is priceless. We came 2 years ago as a family as well. I've been many times but, living in the Midwest makes less frequent trips.. sad day..... So, keep the water flowin.. lots of ways around purchasing water too. Your going to wait in line for the bigger rides and Peter Pan but that's life. We had 5 day park hoppers and we were able to take it slow and enjoy everything multiple times. Utilize fast pass. Go at open and stay til close... those are definitely the slowest hours. A Plus as always Disney besides not having Guardians open when we were there    next time in 2019!! ",Disneyland_California
256112480,4,,United States,"I have been taking my kids to HK Disneyland almost annually since my oldest was two. Now she is 7. My second is 6 and my third is 1.5. We have always loved it as it is a smaller but newer disneyland. Being on the smaller side makes it easier to play in a day. The lines are usually not too horrible compared disneyland in LA. The food is pretty good too. I didn't expect this but my kids suddenly outgrew this park. We went on all their favorite rides and at the end of they day they were actually bored and wanted to head back to the hotel. I think maybe this is also because we took them to Disneyland in LA 6 months ago and Legoland before that and now suddenly they like the bigger rides. This is a still a great park for the little kids. The rental strollers are really lame. They are the hard plastic types where it's impossible for your young one to lay down to nap. And usually the only reason we rent a stroller is just in case the baby needs to snooze. So instead my hubby held the baby the whole time while she slept and I took the older kids to play. If you need a stroller, I recommend bringing your own.",Disneyland_HongKong
518809827,4,2017-08-01,Spain,"Disneyland California was the first Disney park.If you visited any other Disney park, you'll notice it immediately when you look at the castle, which is not as tall as in Orlando or in Europe.However, once you cross the door, you enter in the World of magic, and doesn't matter if you are visiting it with children or not, it's an special place.Of course, it's highly recommended to plan in advance what attractions or spectacles you would like to go, in order to get the most of your time. And make a smart use of fast pass, a free (included in the ticket price) way to avoid queues.It's possible to see all the characters, and take a photograph with them.I like especially the electrical parade, in the night. Of course, there are lots of options to eat and drink, as well as to purchase snacks and different souvenirs. However, I found it more expensive than Disney Orlando, and at the same level than Disneyland Paris.Strollers available for USD 15.00.Anyway, it worth a visit, it's the magic World of Disney.Note: if you are interested in visiting Legoland and SeaWorld (I do not recommend SeaWorld San Diego), check out SoCal Pass.",Disneyland_California

122163446,5,2011-12-01,Australia,"We took our four children (ages 13, 11, 7 and 3) and not only did they have a great time, but we did too. There really is something for everyone. We were warned about food, but actually we were pleasantly surprised. The meal in Blue Bayou was actually pretty good. Above all the staff are always smiling and keen to help.We didn't stay in the resort, and didn't find that a disadvantage. (We stayed at Pelican Hill, Newport Beach, which although luxurious was probably no more expensive than the Disney option)TIPS : Get there early, Figure out how Fast Passes work, and use them, plan your day, Park hop   as you can collect Fast Passes for both California Park aswell as Disney. Dinner at Arial's Grotto (which gives you preferred tickets for the evening World of Colour show) was great. Take or hire a stroller for toddlers, the park is totally designed for them.",Disneyland_California
215588013,5,2014-06-01,United Kingdom,"Now, while I have been to two other Disney parks (albeit very long ago) this park has rekindled my desire to visit every Disneyland, world and everything else they offer again. I went here with my sister and brother (we're all in our 20's), and we all had SUCH a great time! It was just the best day ever. We had a park hopper ticket and started in the adventure park at 11am  which we all thought was better, the rides were brilliant, the queues were manageable and the weather was scorching. If you plan on going between may august I recommend carrying a hat, SPF 50   UV protect sunscreen and A LOT of water. Somehow we managed to leave the park at 12pm with a crap load of merchandise and happy, contented souls after watching the World of Colours show. Which was heartmeltingly amazing. I cried and I'm not even ashamed to admit it! It was a beautiful show, very emotional, especially if you've grown up with Disney.I thoroughly recommend you go, regardless of what age or gender you are, it's simply the best.",Disneyland_California

My only complaint is the locations of the toilets aren't very well signposted and there wasn't enough around the park.

138543593,3,2012-08-01,United Kingdom,"We're a mature couple, we were staying in a chateau for my wife's birthday and as Disney was about an hour's drive away, I'd planned for us to visit there (for a bit of fun) and pre booked the tickets vouchers through Tesco which saved about   40. So, queued for 10 mins. to be told the vouchers had to be exchanged for tickets, queued for 30 mins. Armed with the tickets, decided to visit the  film studios  park first, visited 2 sets, where we queued for approx. an hour each Armageddon was good, apart from the boring intro. The next, a themed ride, showing bits and pieces from various films, which apart from a  tidal wave  and an  explosion  was a waste of time. The  stuntshow , having queued and sat down for another 25 mins. the show was cancelled  due to un forseen circumstances . We then headed for the theme park. First queue was to take the train to see the park. The queueing notice says, 45 mins. at the bottom of the stairs, the queue was a lot shorter approx. 20 mins. After 30 mins, we were still only half way to the platform, unfortunately, this is when, probably through the heat and a lack of seating when queueing, my wife feinted and collapsed, and was rushed to the infirmary, where she was attended to, by a nurse and doctor, given an ECG, blood and heart tests all within 15 mins. of arriving, (ten out of ten). Some 21 2 hours, we were able to leave, the nurse recommended  All you can eat buffet  restaurant, for quality food. To be fair, the food was high quality, but should be at   47 for two. The rest of the time we meandered around the park, not daring to queue and left just before the firework display, to avoid the crush on leaving. We've been to Disney, Florida several times, along with all the other parks they have over there, Paris is a very poor relation, it's very expensive, the queues are too long, and most of the work force are miserable. I'm still trying to work out the queueing and allocation of seats on some of the rides as it seems only the French could come up with some of the systems but if you're going to be ill, that's the place.",Disneyland_Paris

443909273,5,2016-11-01,United States,"I've been to Disneyland every single year at least once since 1955, the year it opened. It's magical. Let's face it, it's not cheap but there is something magical about seeing the looks on kids faces as they see the characters they watch everyday on television. It's a magical place for young and old. I prefer Disneyland over Disney World for those under 12. Disney World is sooooooo spread out kids are exhausted before they even leave one theme park. It's too much. Disneyland California Adventure is much smaller and the area compact so you're not walking as far. There are some excellent restaurants at Disneyland?California Adventure. I would recommend Blue Bayou by Pirates of the Caribbean, Napa Rose in the Grand Californian Hotel, and Carthay Circle Restaurant in California Adventure. All are fine dining and require reservations. You can call the Disney Dine Line for reservations 60 days in advance. I suggest you do it between 50 and 60 days in advance if you are serious about eating there.",Disneyland_California

However, since it was the Diamond Celebration I wanted to visit Disneyland and see it in all its diamond glory.We visited during the Star Wars race weekend, so the crowds were a little larger than we would have liked, but we managed to see everything we wanted to. Tomorrowland was overlayed with Star Wars, and the updates that they include on Space Mountain were amazing. Also love the Disneyland version of Pirates of the Caribbean and Splash Mountain. The castle was all decked out for the big celebration, and the Disneyland Forever fireworks and Paint the Night parade were amazing (must sees if you visit).As I mentioned in my review of California Adventure, my one complaint is the lack of free wifi in the park to make use of the Disneyland app (for line times, etc.). Hopefully Disneyland follows in Disney World's steps and this is added soon.The park is about to go through a major transformation with the addition of Star Wars land, with some rides and attractions closed so that construction can start.

118148094,5,2011-09-01,Australia,We had two days here thursday 8th and Sunday 11 september.The Thursday was by far the better of the two apart from the heat it was a really good day my children could go on the rides they wanted to without huge lines. The wait to see the characters was also reasonable and they never rushed them away.However on the Sunday there was so many people there as it was a long weekend for the the mid autumn festival. There was so many rude pushy people. The lines were huge but that was oK as we had done them all the other day. We did go on some when we saw the lines were smaller. I would recommend if you can do the river cruise ride in the day and again in the night as it is such a different ride at night.So I would also say if you can help it go on week days and NOT long weekends. But sometimes you don't have a choice so in that case go early do all the rides first before it gets to busy.My girls still love the park it was there second trip since march.,Disneyland_HongKong

Lots of food stations and restaurants dotted around, toilets were clean and plentiful. There wasn't a parade at the end of the day due to the fact it had rained and health & safety because of this.

209358178,3,2014-06-01,United States,"We are huge Disney fans, and I am a rabid Historian, Walt Disney has been a huge interest to me. This place left one really let down. Now, lets qualify that: If one is in Europe, and this is the only property one has access to by Disney, then by all means go. And, if one is a Disney nutter, like me go as well. We spent one day, and that was more than enough. The park was run down, first four rides we attempted were broken down, and apparently that is not unusual. The food was below the standards we have come to expect from Disney, the rides when working were in massive disrepair, and seemed to be done on a budget and left unfinished. Walt would not have approved! So, if you go, and you have been to Disneyland California, do not expect that quality! In any way. The upside is the Park is quite beautiful. The detail to some of the areas was amazing, Pirates entry to the attraction was unreal. The ride not as good, but a good experience.

621865247,3,2018-09-01,United Kingdom,"It's about 15 years since my last visit to Disneyland Paris and I came back for the Running Festival but we also had park tickets for 3 days. One thing which doesn't change is the queues. I've been to both US parks as well as Paris a number of times and I've always been impressed with the fact that the queueing times were pretty accurate. Our first ride was Big Thunder Mountain. We decided the 70 minutes was just about okay ..... except because of the Fast Pass, the 70 minutes was actually 2 hours! Not impressed! Also very disappointed that quite a few attractions were closed. I appreciate that maintenance is necessary but this was obviously going to be a very popular weekend and you'd think they'd try to keep as much as possible open. Even the app doesn't give any indication of when things are scheduled to reopen so you can't check in advance when planning your visit.I thought the food was pretty dismal. Most of the restaurants are fast food (often served not so fast) so more queues, and it was quite difficult to actually find a menu to look at. I know things are displayed over the counter but this is a constantly changing display so you can't really see everything that is available. The bright red burger bun in the Brown Derby in the Studios side of the park was particularly revolting! It's also expensive. Around 14 15 Euros for a limp burger, a few fries, drink and a small ice cream. By the end of the weekend I was craving something healthy to eat!I was led to believe Disney staff (sorry, cast members) have certainly strict standards of behaviour to adhere to, but we did have problems with security guards, who said they were Disney security, not the Run Festival. Supporters were supposed to be allowed into the finish area if they had a wrist band but the Disney security were very stroppy and refused to let anyone through, wrist band or not. Their attitude was  I'm Disney security, not race security, and you're not going through! The weekend reminded me why I swore I'll never go back to Orlando. I love the rides but not enough to spend most of my day in a queue, and the food is just grim. So if Disney is the place for you, wear mega comfortable shoes and be prepared to spend a lot of time standing in line for something or other.

606634498,4,2018-08-01,United Kingdom,"With a username like SheLovesDisney, it's pretty obvious I am a Disneyland fanatic. After several years of happy trips to Disneyland California, this was my first visit to Paris and I wasn't disappointed. I still got that buzz walking down Main Street, and most of my favourite rides were here and just as much fun. Hyperspace Mountain is MUCH quicker than the California version which was a surprise   a good one for me, a bad one for my poor 8 year old who didn't like it at all! My 11 year old and I really enjoyed the Indiana Jones ride which is totally different to California. The parade was lovely, with the smoke breathing dragon a highlight. Fireworks were late for families at 11pm, so we only saw them once, but they were totally worth it. Fewer and simpler fireworks, but much more of a light show. A disappointment was the lack of opportunities for spontaneous character meet and greets   you have to book with an app called Lineberty, which is not well publicized and doesn't seem to stop you having to wait in line anyway.Disneyland in the summer is hot and crowded wherever you go in the world. Wait times are long and you have to plan what you want to do and understand systems like fastpass in advance. if you're not up for the challenge, don't do it! That said, DL Paris is just not as slick as DL California operationally, and there are not as many staff on the ground. Queues formed in awkward places, and the rides were often loaded inefficiently due to lack of staff leading to longer queues than were necessary. Nobody was patrolling the build up to the parade or fireworks, so there was pushing in and confusion over whether you should be seated or standing which just didn't happen in California (in my experience).Overall, we had the usual amazing, exhausting time and I got my Disney fix! California still has my heart, but Paris has a lot of that magic.",Disneyland_Paris

We didnt get to ride on space mountain or go to innoventions they were closed because of the earthquakes that had been taking place but other then that we enjoyed ourselves. The places to eat were obviously expensive and we kind of walked in and out of toontown because it was more for younger children. it was truly an amazing experience that my kids and I will always remember.,Disneyland_California

401843478,5,2016-07-01,United States,"My family and I have been to Disneyworld 5 times and my daughter is a huge Walt Disney fan so she wanted to visit Disneyland. We really enjoyed our visit. I purchased a 4 day park hopper pass however you probably can get all you need done in 2 days. Being from North Carolina I wanted to make sure we did it all. The park is smaller than Disneyworld but that is one thing we liked about it. It was Quant and we compared the rides to Disneyworld. Although the two parks had the same name they were different. We enjoyed the rides at Disneyland that Disneyworld didn't have. Finding Nemo  the submarine ride, The Matahorn(sp?) and Indiana Jones. My wife and daughter did the Walk in Walt's footsteps and it was great to them. It is cool walking around Disneyland and seeing personal touches done by Walt Disney. Although Disneyland is in the middle of many hotels and restaurants that have grown up around the Park you still get lost in the magic and not even realize the hustle and bustle outside the gates. If you purchase a park hopper Adventureland is so close we had fast passes in both parks and went back and forth. We loved it and was glad we got to experience Disneyland. ",Disneyland_California
313730679,5,2015-08-01,India,We became Kid for one day! One advice is not to miss the Parade which takes place at 5:30 daily. It was a great experience. Also take full use of the fast pass which are available every 2 hours from the time you take the 1st previous fast pass.. It is very handy in covering more rides!,Disneyland_Paris
559555035,2,2018-02-01,United Kingdom,"Overall experienceVery disappointed. 25% of the rides attractions & facilities were closed for refurbishment. Twice queued for over 30 mins for a ride only to be told there was a technical problem & to come back later. Very few staff around to assist with any queries, all the staff we saw were working on the actual rides.Very few actual Disney characters seen out & about around the parks.Disney Studios park is basically a non event.Getting into the parks the security checkpoints were farcical, too small, not enough of them, long queues, some bags checked some weren't, twice I walked in without putting the contents of my pockets in the tray, the red lights on the scanner were simply ignored.Food & drink outlets, Quality very average, prices very expensive.Retail outletsFar too many of them, all selling exactly the same merchandise at the same outrageously inflated pricesHotelStayed at the New York & really wished I hadn't wasted my money. Have reviewed this separately on Trip Advisor.Value for moneyMost definately not. This is blatant profiteering at its ugliest. We went as a couple, how families with children can afford this place is beyond me and as this whole concept is child orientated I think Disney Corp should be ashamed.Everything (with only 2 exceptions that we came across) from the overall package, the food, drinks, hotel, merchandise is at least 3 times the cost it should be.I'm afraid I only have positive comments for 2 things. 1st   The Wild West Show was very good, expensive at    65 &    80 but compared to everything else the price is approaching acceptable for the entertainment and the food & drink.2nd   Earl of Sandwich food outlet in Disney Village. Selection, variety & quality very good, price of    6.50 for std size sandwich (which is similar to a panini size) or around    11 for double. A few more outlets of this kind & at these types of prices would make a world of difference.Disneyland Paris is one of those places that are a must visit, so one can say Been there, seen it, done it. Now we have done that, we won't be returning anytime soon.",Disneyland_Paris

I thought it would be expensive, but it was reasonable. great variety of food from Mexican to German and everything in between. I enjoyed most of all the 3D attractions. the house of horror was also very scary. I would go back anytime. I recommend at least three days of fun, including the california adventure next door.",Disneyland_California
363148471,4,2016-04-01,United States,"I've been coming to Disneyland for over 40 years and this visit was probably my last because the crowds are too much. During the opening days of the Star Wars productions the Monorail shut down for unknown reasons AND the railroad wasn't running either. That meant trudging through the crowds on foot from one end of the park to the other AND no relief to get back to your Disneyland Hotel. Really? I also witnessed park workers actually being rude to guests. That was a first and most surprising. In terms of process, the Fast Pass is the only way to go or you will waste much of your time waiting in line. Make reservations for dining before you leave home or you will be left to the expensive, low quality fast food. Beware of green blue tinted Galactic French Toast in Tomorrowland  you'll see it later. Disneyland just isn't what it used to be for relaxed pleasure. You need to train before you go, leave babies at home and plot your strategy to get your money's worth.",Disneyland_California

42780478,4,,United States,"I can understand that southern california is a crowded place, however, I think the themeparks should consider limiting how many people enter their themeparks, for the sake of enjoyment. All the lines were very long, so we didn't get to see as much as we wantedWith that aside, I do have to say we did enjoy our time at Disneyland. The staff there are friendly, and the park is very clean. You can almost imagine what it was like when the park was opened, as many of the attractions are still the same, giving you that 'remember when' feeling of what themeparks were like before hype and 'thrill' rides took over. Its a great place to take a family, but be prepared, as the prices are much higher than they use to be.

126646544,2,2012-03-01,United Kingdom,We found that the studios tour parc was so much better for our family than the main park. The Hollywood Hotel ride was great and the studio stunts tour was really good and we sepnt a good day in that parc. The other parc aart from the wow factor of main street looking like oldie world USA the main parc was so geared towards little kids and my kids were a bit bored by it. I can not believe what people will a. queue for b. pay for. 7.50 euro for a balloon and queueing to have a photo with minnie mouse! I was very surprised that the characters were not walking around the park. My best advice is DO NOT try leaving the aprk after the 5pm parade it is a scrum and well worth sitting and waiting until it empties a bit. I do not recommend anyone with children older than 10 yrs to go here Alton towers or chessington would be far better. Pack drinks and snacks and eat them in the very long queues. The fast pass is only on a very few rides.,Disneyland_Paris

We took snack packs and squeezey squash and used the water fountains to refill. Saved a fortune. Love how clean the place is though. There are always people on hand if you need anything.

The queues for some rides are ridiculous. Including some of the queues for meeting characters. The closing show is fantastic however people need to have manners. There should be a rule for the public to SIT down to allow others to see the closing show. Especially if young kids want to see the ending showing. Other than that great! Would love to go again. ,Disneyland_Paris
320127300,4,2015-10-01,United Kingdom,"I went with an open mind as I have been to all the other Disney parks. It is very compact and easy to cover in a day. The two best rides for adults teens are Space Mountain and Grizzly gulch mine train. Notably missing are Pirates of the Carribean Splash mountain and Peter Pan rides. The park is more geared up for small children. The food is mainly geared towards the Chinese. For Westerners, there are burgers, pizza and spaghetti Virtually nothing for vegetarians.( I had spaghetti and mushroom sauce). Everything is overpriced, even the merchandise. On the plus side the parades are lovely and worth staying for the night parade and fireworks. The park is cheaper than its American counterparts, about   45  USD 70. compared to   75 USD 100. Worth visiting, but if you like hairier rides head for Ocean Park which is cheaper.",Disneyland_HongKong

Wait times weren't too long, we managed to use the fast passes to our advantage despite it being our first time and I would definitely recommend learning about how to use them before you attend the park if you only have a day or two to spend at the resort as it will ensure that you get to enjoy the main rides in the park. The production value of the parade was fantastic and the fireworks were magical, especially with the fake snowfall at the end (christmas time). Food at the park is very sugar laden and expensive (especially for NZ'ers I would say), I distinctly remember the smell of cotton candy and popcorn permeating the entire park, however I was 3 months pregnant at the time lol I would recommend either bringing your own food or crossing the road to eat at Denny's or IHOP , both of which were decent. Staff were helpful and polite, transport to and from our hotel on the shuttle was reliable and cheap.

Before I came here, my friends said that this disneyland is small compared to other disneyland. But I think that there is a lot to do and I did not cover even half of it in the whole day I was there.As soon as I entered the park, I saw the train ride. It takes you from one station to the other. I did not do any rides as there were lots of big queues for them. I thought that the shows here are what sets disneyland apart from other theme parks, so I aimed at watching as many shows as possible. If you had time to watch two shows then watch the Lion King show and Mickey's wonderous story (they are both musicals). They are a sight to behold. There is also a parade at 3.30pm and another at 7.30pm. Both are definitely worth seeing. The magical day ended with a fireworks show outside the castle at 9pm.The people are very helpful in Disneyland and if you need help they will go the extra mile to make sure you are comfortable. Before entering the park you have to go through a security check where they make sure you are not carrying any food with you. They prefer you eat their overpriced and greasy food inside the park. There are a lot of greasy and sugary options in there. Not a lot of healthy options and basically no vegetarian options other than potato chips.

The fireworks at the end of the day are worth watching as was the mid afternoon parade. We ate at the corner caf   in the main street USA.

We were aware that it could easily have been cold and rainy but the thing is Disneyland Paris manages adverse weather so much better than they do in Florida. It   s been a good few years since our last visit and they have made some great improvements on site. Toy story rides are great and the whole area is really well done. Rattattoie ride, Chez Reme, Marie   s shop etc all look beautiful it was a very busy space and clearly a lot of people like hanging out here. This trip our luck was in and it was warm and sunny the whole trip which gave us a chance to take a good look around both parks. We had a half board meal plan with breakfast at the Hyperion every morning. The breakfast was good although queues were very long. We had a lunch in Cafe des stars and evening meal in Plaza Gardens both of which had great food. The 25th Anniversary Fireworks and projections on the side of the castle were stunning. Seeing both parks so close together makes you realise just how much better some of the styling is in Paris than in Florida it is a real shame that they are trying to retheme things like Hyperspace Mountain as the original moon train element was so much better. It was a shame to see Phantom Manor and Indiana Jones we   re out of action but we are looking forward to coming back later and seeing the work completed.",Disneyland_Paris

I thought, after the faced paced cartoons they watch and the rides they loved, they would think this was a little slow, on the contrary, they sang our loud and rocked to and fro while pointing out the kids doing things like they did. Russel's Redwood Creek Adventure Trail was a huge hit. I think the kids could have spent all day there. Mind you, we had sixteen, thirteen, four and two years old and they all loved it. Radiator Springs was more fun for Mommy than the kids, but the Dot's water playland was a hit with all. We even said to the little ones as we walked into the Bug's Life area, we're shrinking! We're shrinking! They loved it.Battling Darth Vader was a HUGE hit! Brilliant idea, Disney. We saw two parades, and they enchanted me again. My friend and I held the little ones so they could see, and they were mesmerized for the length of the whole parade. Such fun. We stayed till the little ones fell asleep in their strollers. Disney just knows how to set up a family day right. Just enough benches for the grown ups, just enough coffee houses.I could have skipped Downtown Disney. Very much all about shopping and drinking.

He did well the first few times but after that we were losing the will to live. A 60 min (and in some cases it was MORE!) wait with young children in the immense heat for a 2 min ride... Everything was super eye wateringly expensive. But the queues were just disgusting. A 45 min wait for RIDES, for FOOD (minimum 30 min at one place) was all too much. Then a 90 minute wait at the Eurostar just to get through passport control in a horrible sweaty queue again with kids and babies crying and whinging kids (understandably so!) Now we are back, it still made great memories for our child and seeing his face on those rides that took an hour to queue for makes it all worth it, but really they need to sort out this queuing system, let less people in, have some kind of system but currently the queue situation is HELL ON EARTH. We had fast pass but not all rides have fast pass option. Some fast pass queues are still long (40 mins plus as opposed to 60 mins plus ). It got us into Peter Pan ride quite quick (well 15 min but to us that was super fast!) but thats about it. Would love to come here for my sons next birthday but wow... I just don't know.

We went on July 28th, 2009 and entered a  short  line at Splash Mountain which had just recovered from a breakdown. After 70 minutes we had reached the boarding station and ride broke down again. Another 20 minutes later just standing still, our small children could not bear anymore and we decided to leave. I argued for a while with a cast member that we should be given fastpasses, but it was stay in line for an indefinite amount of time or loose your spot. I cannot believe they treat people that way. Because the waiting time on any attraction averaged 45 minutes and we went through 3 more breakdowns at other rides, we managed to do only 10 attractions in a whole day, even making the best use of fastpasses. The bad treatment at Splash Mountain made our day at Disney less then memorable.",Disneyland_California
491186419,4,2017-06-01,United Kingdom,"Went here for a day trip with family, park was clean and tidy, accessible and magical for our youngest daughter who is 3. Some long que times so recommend using the fast pass system to get time slots to go back to them, this can sometimes take 45 minutes off waiting which is vital when trying to keep a 3 and a 5 year old entertained.Was expecting more rides and from what I could make out a lot of it has remained unchanged for the past 10 years. It was a shame the characters weren't readily available or accessible, you had to queue to meet them which we refrained from doing as some of these were at least 45 minutes long. Difficult to do all in one day so would recommend at least a couple of days for a visit.",Disneyland_Paris
659743835,2,2019-03-01,United States,We used to love it at Disneyland but the park is literally just getting busier and busier everytime we go.

642534419,2,2018-12-01,Singapore,Our two day visit to Disneyland was a bitter disappointment. The park was so busy you could not move around freely. The average wait time for each ride was 60 minutes. There is no option of a fast pass as is the norm in many other theme parks around the world. We did not see the Disney Princesses for a photo opportunity (which was the only reason my youngest two wanted to go to Disneyland) and all the other photo opportunities were full before we even arrived at the destination. The train around the park only went one way and did not return to its point of departure. The lines for coffee and food resulted in is leaving the park earlier than we anticipated because the wait was too long. A very disappointing experience to say the least and we will not be back! Please do not visit during the Christmas New Year season!,Disneyland_HongKong

247440891,4,2014-12-01,United Kingdom,"We came to DIsneyland Paris on NYE with the Express tours. We therefore spent around 8 hours in Disneyland Park. The park itself is beautiful, a truly magical place. It does however have it's flaws.The queue times for rides were absolutely absurd, I know it was NYE and there were thousands of people in the Park, but I think that maybe Disney should put a limit to the amount of people in the Park at one time. All of the rides, and I mean all of them, had 2 hour   queue times. The Princess Pavillion to meet the princesses had the same waiting time, as well as the Meet Mickey attraction. We did queue for the train that goes around the park, however we were told when we first started queuing that we would be waiting no more than 30 minutes. We ended up queuing for 1 hour 30 minutes in the freezing cold and no one telling us why we were made to wait for so long when there were plenty of empty carriages and seats on every train going by. In the end, the train wasn't even worth it and we got off at another station around the park. We thought the train would show us the whole park, but there's a 2 meter bush that cuts off your view!In regards to the food outlets and options available, we weren't impressed by this either. The gastronomical options were few and far between. Nothing exciting whatsoever, I was expecting mickey shaped waffles for breakfast etc but nothing like that, bland and rubbish fast food instead. And the prices were ridiculous, we ended up spending 75 euros on food and we only had 2 meals which were far from satisfactory. The staff in the Cowboy cafe looked like they wanted to kill themselves, not very Disney like at all and put a bummer on my day. At around 4.30pm when we wanted to sit down in the warm with a coffee, there were absolutely no seats inside anywhere due to the massive crowds. We were forced to attempt to eat a croque monsior standing up in the arcade area, with people pushing past us to get into shops. This, I think, needs addressing. Surely a place like Disneyland should be fully prepared for the crowds and make sure there are enough places for guests to sit down??The Christmas parade was very good, as was Elsa and Anna's little horse ride down Main Street. The park is a wonderful place to be in, I just think there are a few areas that need looking at.Overall, I would come back here again but will bring a picnic next time.",Disneyland_Paris
51510796,2,,Ireland,"I have brought my family to Disney's parks in California, Florida and Paris several times over the past 10 years. The US parks are fantastic, they really know how to create the MAGIC. However, Disneyland Paris is a disgraceful reflection of Disney   s customer service ethos. In general, I found their employees to be very rude, arrogant and disinterested in my experience of the parks. I have just returned from a 5 day trip and we have decided that we will never return to Paris for Disneyland. Its a shame because the attractions are actually quite good. The new Crush Coaster is excellent, as is the Tower of Terror, the live motorshow, Aerosmith Coaster, Haunted Mansion, Thunder Mountain, Space Mountain and a whole load of other attractions that most children can get on.It was  4C most of the time we were there, which was great as its really felt like Christmas with real snow on the ground.Disney, if you read these reports     send some of your heavy hitters to Paris to sort out this mess before you lose your investment.We will try PortAventura in Spain next time.",Disneyland_Paris

Can really recommend The Pirates of The Caribean ride followed by lunch in The Blue Lagoon Restaurant. The whole family enjoyed this. Unfortunatley there is absoluteley nothing for the under threes so my poor 1 year old spent most of the time stuck in her pram. There were no play areas for a pair of little legs to run off steam and there was only one baby care facility in the entire park. There were no baby changing facilities in any of the restaurants. We stayed at the Santa Fe Hotel, one of Disney's own and was very impressed with the standard of accommodation despite it only having a two star rating. I've stayed in four star hotels that weren't as comfortable and the staff were exceptional. Food was buffet style and was more quantity than quality but you could eat as much as you like.

661955342,3,2019-03-01,Australia,"We were disappointed with HK Disneyland. The train wasn't running and the Castle was under renovation, as were several other areas. It had an air of dilapidation. Our coach driver advised us to take food in, not in our bags, which would be searched, but in our pockets. The reason for this was that They want to make you pay the incredibly high prices for food they sell. He also suggested not buying souvenirs there, but taking a picture, then getting the item from Ali Baba (or Ali Express I suppose). A basic souvenir mug cost A$20 approx, and watches were about A$80. The parade though, was fantastic, and made up a lot for the rest of it. It's on twice a day, in the afternoon and evening. The fireworks that we'd previously seen there were suspended for a while, due to the renovations. An MTR station is right there at the gates   change at Central for other lines. There's also a ferry but it limits you to certain times of leaving, so MTR, taxi or bus is better. For a senior, HK$2 on the Oyster Seniors card gets you all the way back to a station close to your hotel, so don't bother with a tour. ",Disneyland_HongKong
381027395,5,2015-09-01,United Kingdom,"Ever since I was a kid I have desperately wanted to go to Disneyland, always imagining how good it would be. So at 27 years old the day finally arrived when I along with my wife, 3 tiny children and the in laws descended on Disneyland Park for one truly amazing day and it was better than I ever imagined. The kids loved it, my wife loved it, the in laws loved it and I definitely loved it! We just went for one day so cannot comment on how it would be to stay for longer but on that one day we crammed in as much as we could and still didn't manage to do it all even being there from park opening to closing. There is so so so much to do. The closing ceremony fireworks show was flat out the best sound and light display you will see and the rides fill needs for all ages! Our particular ride highlights were Big Thunder Mountain, Pirates of the Caribbean and Peter Pans Flight. Alice's curious labyrinth was also a great chance to relive Classic Disney moments. Now on the food matter, it's Disneyland so don't expect a hearty lunch for a fiver as it is pricey but the vendor carts can provide a slightly cheaper alternative if you're on a day visit. The staff were incredibly helpful, friendly and the cast really got into the spirit of things for the kids. Our son and daughter were dressed as Peter Pan and Tinkerbell so got special attention from the 'real' Peter, Wendy, Tinkerbell and random pirates. Plus they got free fast pass access on the Peter Pans Flight ride.

The gift shops were reasonably priced and had lots of choice, the food choices were poor and some food kiosks only took cash, but didn't tell you this until you were trying to pay.

That being said, we had an amazing day and were very impressed with the interactions of all the characters with the kids. It was great to see the characters enjoying the rides as well. Bert and Marry Poppins were a huge hit! The ride line ups are long but the Disney app is a nice way to know which ones have the shortest wait times.

My wife and I only got a chance to ride 2 rides... teacup and its a small world. Both had the least amount of people... the its a small world wss definitely a plus for a 2 year old.

Even to take a picture with your favorite hero you have to wait in a queue 40min and then pay 16EUR for a pic. Also, food...there is no chance to find normal meal in both parks. Only fast food with the prices of an expensive restaurant. Even McDonalds felt like the best food ever after what we have eaten in this Disneyland. Moreover, the parks are dirty   toilets are a disaster. They definitely need more personnel! And last but not least. What disappointed us most of all is that the roller coasters or attractions were continuously broken and paused. Imagine, you stand in a queue for 50min and when you are so close to get into a roller coaster and have a ride they announce that they have a technical problem and you have to get out and come back LATER. This happened to us 5 times in 2 days! We lost half of our time just waiting in a queue and then turning back because of a technical problem. This is NOT ACCEPTABLE for this kind of amusement parks. I must say that EUROPA PARK in Germany is much better and I have never seen something like this there. I will defiantly never go back to Disneyland again.

When we arrived it was early, the park hadn't opened yet so we looked around and enjoyed the atmosphere. We began to notice that we were among the minority, there were very few children there. It was all mainly adults, and not just young adults but older couples too. We thought this was great that the kids would be able to go on the rides quicker as surely all these people would not be waiting for young children's rides....we were wrong, not only were they all going on these rides but they seemed to think they had priority over the children and we were pushed out of line in a few instances and they were constantly trying to nudge through the waiting queues.

This happened to us too many times in this weekend. Also Disneyland Paris is still not very friendly for small children when it is about the Disney figures for photographing : it still may happen that when you may expect to shoot a photo during the time which is mentioned on the clock the Disney figure starts walking and does not come back.

Clean, staff was friendly, and very affordable!All except one of our family has been to Disneyland & California Adventures. We purchased the trip through Costco Travel so I can   t complain one bit about the ticket price and hotel cost. 16 year old is a Type 1 Diabetic and last trip they accommodated this illness splendidly. This go round was an overall disappointment, went to City Hall to see about accommodations and the female staff was polite but more or less said too bad but enjoy your visit with your diabetic. Didn   t expect special treatment but without any accommodations made it difficult to maintain good blood sugar levels when the entire day is spent standing in long lines. We were told that the rest of our party could save a place in line for her if she needed to attend to her symptoms. Get real Disney staff! While we did use Fastpass options our first day (Monday May 14) we were able to get onto 6 popular rides only and were onsite for over 10 hours! Spouse had a brain tumor removed about 45 days prior. His right leg was still weak from the procedure so we finally ended up renting a wheelchair to ease his discomfort. I appreciated the ability to get a return time for a ride and had few problems with this accommodation. Different story when you use a Fastpass and the wheelchair entrance. While staff was overall friendly about it you do get pushed to the side and placed on hold until they deem fit to grant you access. Would have been faster to use the Fastpass    normally   . Didn   t stress about it with the return time procedure as you typically were told to return prior to the standby wait time. Last time here we commented on how clean the parks were, still the same but I am seeing some of the rides and attractions are showing wear and tear and fading paint colors. Also noticed that staff were somewhat disgruntled whether this is from poor wages, hours, or constant torture from errant children and inattentive parents it placed a sour note for all of my family. Let   s talk about strollers, stroller parking areas, stroller drivers, stroller right of ways. Think there might be a new Disneyland area called    Stroller Sarcophagus   . Heaven forbid you try to walk through an area that is deemed a walkway because stroller parking lot is the new norm. Attempting this with someone in a wheelchair is not for the faint of heart! Forget about being injured on an attraction, walking to them was where we all received bumps, scratches, and bruises as souvenirs for the day. Sad to say that the Pirates ride was closed for refurbishment during our visit. There wasn   t as many characters to visit with as in past trips either. Thank heavens we did get to take a picture with Captain Jack though! Didn   t use the Photo pass option so you were told to quickly move along. Maybe because my kids are older but Disneyland was not as enjoyable as in past visits. The parks seemed so much more commercially centered then when it was about Walt   s original vision. Sad. Especially for the cost of admission. One member of our party   s pass stopped working at the Fastpass kiosk. Was told to go to City Hall for replacement. Regardless of it being our final day in the park the staff issued a paper ticket and then kept the    souvenir    pass. When it was asked to be returned as a keepsake was told that they couldn   t do that. We asked for a supervisor and were told that there wasn   t one available as they are all supervisors in City Hall. When questioned further about this the staffer then became flustered being caught in a lie so she said there was nothing further she or anyone could do for us. As the other 5 members of our group already had a Fastpass for the ride could we get another one for this member. She flat out said it wasn   t possible. Frustrating to say the least. California Adventures day was better but with the rollercoaster and Ferris wheel being closed for refurbishment there really wasn   t a lot of options for us as we didn   t have little kids to placate or need to join the stroller brigade. California Adventures was dwindled down to lots of eating options, expensive alcohol, and roughly 5 attractions to hold our interest unless we paid to shop all day. Highlight of our day here was the parade attendant who put on the best comedy and dance routine while directing pedestrian traffic before the parade. Last thing to note: be prepared to be pushed out of the parks after the parade or fireworks. There is no way to get to a different    land    other than the gates with the way you   re driven like cattle and jockeying for position between the stroller brigades. The fireworks display is great but would it be too much to ask if you closed the umbrellas for more people to be able to view the images on the castle??? Will we be back? Yes but better prepared with strategies to get around the park, platinum admission cards, and shin guards for nefarious strollers drivers and passengers! May the Force be with me!",Disneyland_California

320181041,2,2015-10-01,United States,"I think this will be our last trip to Disneyland. The prices have become outrageous to just stand in line for 1   2 hours to ride an attraction and be jostled about by so many people. There are not enough benches for seating for older members of our family who need to sit down and rest at times. It was very hot and humid when we were there and it was just too hot standing in the sun in long, crowded lines.We tried to watch the fireworks one night and people crowded themselves in very early to the front of the park. Everywhere we tried to stand we were told we had to move yet they have sections blocked off with empty benches for 'company' employees. We watched the clean up people walk along and make an attempt to sweep a piece of paper into their receptacle but if they missed it, they just walked on. It isn't the same clean and enjoyable experience we used to enjoy in years past. I think Walt Disney would be very disappointed by how it has changed. Food is terribly expensive and on hot days, drinks are exorbitant!! $4.49 for a small bottle of lemonade!!!!",Disneyland_California

They are constructing a new right over there and couple were under maintenance too. The castle in there is tiny compared to the one in Disneyland Orlando! ",Disneyland_California

I grew up less than 10 miles from the park. Now I live in Texas and try to get back as often as possible. This was our second trip with our 6 year old grandson and he was so excited to go back. Watching him get picked for the Jedi Training was one of the biggest highlights of our vacation. We spent 2 days at each park and got to do everything that we wanted to do and some things 2 or 3 times. I suggest that you try everything. You never know what will be your favorite. Let go and be a kid again. For me, there is nothing better in this world than to spend time with my loved ones at a Disney park. Thanks, Walt!!!!! You did good!

1833928,5,,United States,"No one could understand why I would travel twice the distance to California to go to Disney rather than just go to the Orlando resort. New Englanders will tell you that Disneyland pales next to Disneyworld. Well, they are wrong! These people probably went twenty years ago when Florida first opened. I was at Disneyworld last July and just returned from Disneyland in April. Disneyland eerily reminded me of when I was 11 and Disneyworld first opened. Cleaner, crisper grounds. Many more topiaries. Mr. Toad's Wild Ride. Even the same rides are better kept up and just better. Yes, they are different. For example, Small World and Pirates are not the same ride in the two parks. Ditto for the haunted mansion, thunder mountain, and the list goes on. California Adventure had a fascinating Sorceror's Workshop that you can't miss and Florida needs to add an attraction like  Soaring Over California . Flights from the East are now comparable to going to Florida, so take a chance and choose California. We flew in and out of San Diego, Disney is a 95 mile ride from San Diego. We spent two nights in San Diego (Pacific Beach), three nights in Anaheim, then two more nights in San Diego. You will get memories to last a lifetime.

The MRT trip from downtown Kowloon is simple to say the least and took about 50 mins. The gates open at 10am for a wander and many photo opportunities with well loved characters, the    lands    open at 10.30am. The new Ironman experience was easy for a couple of grandparents and we thought the transformer ride at Universal Studios much more exciting. Young and old would love it....youths would find it tame. The staff are all friendly and extremely helpful and do their best to make it a happy place. We visited today, midweek and there were no lines for anything, whatever rude or experience you wanted you just wandered to it. There were 3 Main Street parades doe to being Halloween I think. They were good, quick and not crowded. The Lion King Show is a stand out, it was in 2013 and still is. The Star Wars ride is just the old Space Mountain ride with a new name. We enjoyed Toy Story land. As grandparents we enjoyed watching the expressions on the faces of children mostly aged between 3 to 6 they were in their element. I can   t imagine teenagers thinking it was very exciting.Would we recommend it.....yes would we do it a third time....probably not,Still if you   ve never been to Disneyland and can   t get to USA...do it.",Disneyland_HongKong

I wish the park was bigger though with more rides. (Florida Disney so much bigger). Also there seems to be a real lack of characters. Years ago you saw characters constantly all around the park (now it is just at certain times and photo opportunities. This is a great shame. ",Disneyland_Paris

427642229,3,2016-10-01,United States,"I came here as a child in 1987, and and my wife and I decided to bring our 8 year old niece on a trip from Minnesota to Disneyland. Since we could only be here one day, we purchased single day passes which were about $95 for adults and $85 for her. Parking is an additional $18 in the massive ramp, from where you are shuttled to the main gate. After standing in line nearly 40 minutes just to purchase tickets, we were finally in the park. We picked up a map and planned our route, first stopping at Space Mountain. The line there allegedly was 40 minutes long, but we waited about 70 minutes to get on the ride. There is a handy app you can get on your smartphone that lists wait times for many of the rides, so you can plan your attack accordingly. We found that the wait times for the major rides all underestimated by at least 15 minutes.Food is very expensive, as it is at all tourist traps. Hot dogs are around $7 a la carte, soft drinks are about $4. Communication from employees is poor. Rides would go offline with numerous people in line, and nothing would be announced. People would be standing in line to take a picture with a character, and the character would leave without patrons being told if they would return, at all. Disneyland is an amusement park on steroids, and they know they've got you right in their claws. Do it once for your kids, then just go to the local amusement park in your state each of the next three or four summers for the same price you are paying for this one trip to Disney.",Disneyland_California

While it was nicely landscaped and pleasant to walk around, we felt that it was very much geared to families with small children     not teenagers or big kids (like us). It had no Indiana Jones Adventure, no Haunted Mansion, no Pirates of the Caribbean, no Star Tours. They were building an Ironman ride though. It seemed to us, that all the types of rides we were hoping for had been replaced with expensive food outlets and gift shops. So the admission cost was not really value for money in our opinion.

Well that would have been good to know before we entered the park. Did not get park hopper passes because we are adults with no kids and were planning on going to one park per day.

Of course the classical characters are always around, ready to welcome you, entertain you and have themselves photographed by you. The street parades are some of the things I always look forward to every time I visit this place. The queues to the rides may sometimes get long, but you have the option to avail of a fast track pass. I suggest that you avoid the weekends and holidays when the park really gets jam packed.

6539703,3,,United Kingdom,"My husband and I decided to visit Disneyland Paris after being to L.A in the summer.Our main aim was to see if it was a good as L.A and try to re live those dreams we had in L.A.On stepping into the park, it was like a dream.We were on the main street which is an exact replicar of Disney L.A   it was like dejavu.It was great looking round every corner and taking bets on what ride would be there.All the rides were great but we did have lots of queing some as long as an hour which was unlike L.A and not fun in bad weather.The castle was fantastic (especially at night) and would go as far to say it was better than the one in L.A   it even had a dragon in the dungeons!The food was very expensive but nothing out of the ordinary for Disney parks.The parade's were fantastic and we got the same buzz.At one stage we were walking along the main street and it started snowing which blew us away.It was amazing how they managed to have it snowing in the street, You would definitely be fooled into thinking it was real   as we did for a few seconds! It made our trip just that bit extra special.The only thing we were deeply disapointed in was Disney Stidios   what a WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME.I wish I hadn't wasted   60 and stayed in Disney instead for longer.For a start the studio tour was closed (which is the only thing worth doing) also the Areosmith coaster was shut down, and the parade they had on was something you would see in blackpool.It was a sham and would recomend paying to go in Disney another day instead of the studio's.I don't know how they can sell you tickets for a place that's not finished and had two rides to go on that are far from exciting????The Downtown Disney is just as bad   its seriously out of date and has no Disney feel to it at all. With very little choice of places to eat and no nightlife. Which is a shame seen as the one in L.A is like another Disney (so much to do, you could stay there all night as we did with live music in the street etc..)

It had been 19 years since I had last visited Disneyland as a child, and I was so thrilled that I could finally bring my child here to visit! The park still looked the same as I remember it being as a child. I liked how they had added the Disney characters into the Small World ride. We enjoyed family style lunch at Big Thunder Ranch BBQ, where you can have all you can eat cornbread loaves, baked beans, coleslaw, BBQ chicken, BBQ ribs, and corn in the cob! It was delicious! It was nice to see how the Main Street Electrical Parade had been updated, as well as the fireworks show. We really enjoyed Disney's Paint The Night Electrical Parade with its awesome light performances, followed by the Disneyland Forever fireworks show. The show left me feeling like a happy child all over again! It's a must see! The downfall to our visit was that we had gone in the summer and the lines were outrageous! We used our Fast Passes as much as we could for the rides. We also experienced some of the rides failing. The Haunted Mansion Ride broke down twice while we were on it, and the Indiana Jones ride was dark most of the time (and the rock at the end didn't even roll). There was construction also on Tom's Sawyer Island. We will definitely be back, but at a time when the park is not busy so our family is able to enjoy the whole park. ",Disneyland_California

It brings back the kid in me! I go around with a silly happy grin. Sure there are too many people there at times making lines super long, but go mid week, not during the summer or any vacation holidays, go early in the day, use a Fast Pass when available, and go into the single rider line for really long waits. The stuff going on around, movies, character meets, exhibits, shows, etc, all add to the attraction that Disney holds. This is a multi day park, as the rides and the spaces where you stand in line all have something fun to read or look at. We usually go for 2 3 days with a Park hopper, go one day to California Adventures with a visit in the evening for fireworks and other shows, then 2 days in Disneyland Park. We did notice this time that there were some cast members who didn't seem as thrilled to be there as they normally look. A few were in a hurry to get to their break so when we asked a cast member probably on his way to his lunch, he sort of answered as he continued walking, and there were some with less than happy faces, but at other times we ran into sweepers who would chat with us about some show or event we ought to go to or a ride that had a hidden interesting object. Overall we thot the staff was ok, just not as  happy  as some of our past visits.Also, during less popular times, some rides are shut for maintenance.

We both liked it better than DisneyWorld. If you stay in one of the park hotels, you never have to drive anywhere or get into any motor vehicle between parks. The entrances to both parks are right across from each other, with Downtown Disney just around the corner. Between the two parks, it has most of the best rides from Disney World, including some of the adult themed areas, though instead of Epcot, California Adventure offers a boardwalk and wine area a la Napa Valley.We had a 2 year old and a 6 month old and each had enough to do, though the baby spent most of the time sleeping. It was really easy to get around, with plenty of shade. Because it's southern California and not central Florida, the weather's also a little nicer (cooler and drier). We went in late May, the week before Memorial Day, so the crowds weren't that bad. The only ride that consistently had a wait longer than 30 mins was the new Cars ride. Certain rides do close early for the evening show at California Adventure. The early entrance was a great bonus for those staying in the Disney hotels. We got in more rides than we thought we would.

219696960,5,2014-07-01,United Kingdom,"Having been to Disneyland Paris with our sons several times, we thought we knew all there was to know about 'doing' Disney with kids. How wrong we were! This time, we only took our daughter, aged 5, and saw the parks in a whole new light.For a start, all the dressing up stuff we had largely ignored before was suddenly very important. Everywhere we looked there were little girls dressed as Elsa, Anna, Belle, Merida et al. The 'real' princesses had meet and greet sessions where they chatted with their small fans and posed for photographs. It was all very sweet. The rides are obviously an important part of Disney, and we went on almost everything that our daughter was tall enough for   the old favourites like It's a Small World, the Snow White and Peter Pan rides, the tea cups, the carousel, and also the brand new Ratatouille, a very clever 3D ride. Our daughter also enjoyed the shows   Animagique, the Disney Junior show   and the parade. Unfortunately, in the summer the fireworks don't take place until around 11pm, which was far too late for our little one.Our daughter was slightly unwell during our visit, but the first aiders were excellent   helpful, thorough and able to advise on the necessary course of action. Although it isn't possible to buy infant paracetamol in the parks, hotels or village, the first aiders will take temperatures, give a dose as necessary (after first checking weight to get the dosage correct) and advise on contacting the doctor and finding the pharmacy (which is one train stop away, at the shopping village).Food has improved since our last visit (5 years ago), with salads and vegetarian options now being more readily available. The two character meals we had, breakfast and dinner, both at Caf   Mickey, were fantastic, and it was possible to get a decent quality take out meal from Annette's Diner.We were on the half board plus plan, which included breakfast, a meal voucher for either a served or buffet restaurant and a teatime treat (either a pastry or ice cream, with a hot or cold drink). It was excellent value, and the served restaurants can be booked well in advance.As my husband is disabled and uses a mobility scooter, access is very important to us when choosing a holiday, and Disney is second to none for disabled access. We obtained a priority card and disabled access guide from City Hall when we arrived, and this allowed us to use the preferred entrance (usually either the FastPass entrance or the exit) to enter the rides and shows. Whilst it isn't a 'queue jumping' card, in practice it cuts down the wait or allows the person with mobility problems to sit in a comfortable place whilst waiting. It also means the staff will slow down or stop rides to allow the person onto them, and will direct them to special seating areas within shows so the family can be seated next to the wheelchair scooter. Cards can also be issued to expectant mums, people with learning difficulties and conditions like autism, anything that makes queuing problematic.The staff were helpful overall, and unfailingly smiley when dealing with children.",Disneyland_Paris

We have been to the park before as well as the Magic Kingdom in Florida. Even though Florida gets my preference, there is something about the Paris park that cannot be equalized. The theming is perfect, the use of the arcades is unique and gives Mainstreet a completeley different experience. The Disneyland park is smaller, but they make very good use of the space. Big Thunder Mountain going under water and riding on an island for instance. Also the rides like Phantom Manor and Pirates of the Caribbean are a little more detailed in my opinion. I love it. French is the spoken language, but everyone speaks English and all the signs are in English. Also the rides are mixed English and French.Can't wait to visit again. ",Disneyland_Paris
320437175,5,2015-04-01,United States,I had gone along with my friends and we had booked the ticket prior to our Trip.Disneyland is very easily accessible by public transport.We had direct train and its very convenient to reach there.The park is too good and reminded me of all Disney characters in action.We have lots of rides and in between you have many shows which you can go and watch in the theatres inside.the parks are closer to each other and we did not have to wait for a really long time for many rides.Its a very beautiful place and a must visit if you are in Paris.,Disneyland_Paris
160878145,2,2013-04-01,India,"HKD 450 for adults, 320 or children is an outrageous price for HK Disney. It completely lacks the Disney Magic and is so small that I could not believe they could charge so much for this tiny park. Take the main Castle for instance. The one in Florida looks like a real castle while this one looks like a miniature put in for the sake of making it look like a Disney theme park. The overall feel of Disney is completely missing from HK Disney. It just does not seem magical at all! The rides barring 2 or 3 are really lame...good for a 5 year old perhaps.The Grizzly bear ride was nice and the fireworks show is good at night. They have provided plenty of water fountains which is good. Snacks are expensive (HKD 35 for a small popcorn or HKD 28 for cotton candy). Inspite of reports that Disney wont allow you to carry your own food, we took plenty of it. I would have strongly argued that they cant decide what I should eat and what I shouldn't and cannot stop me from taking my own food inside (we are vegetarian so our choice is extremely limited in such places) . They looked at my bags and the food but didnt stop me from taking it in.My honest suggestion is for people to visit Ocean Park. Half the price, 10 times the size (no exaggeration) and much more entertaining. My kids agree! This is especially true if you are planning to visit Disney in Florida anytime in your life. Dont waste time on HK Disney.As of early May if you bought tickets with a VISA card, you could get 11% off at the ticket booth outside Disney. Also bear in mind that all restaurants in the park close when the park closes. This means if you wish to have dinner, it has to be  instead  of the rides. They wont serve anything post the fire works show.",Disneyland_HongKong

We planned our trip specifically around the Christmas decorations and we were so happy we did! We traveled to Disneyland midweek two weeks before Thanksgiving.

Get the Fast Pass thing down and your waiting time will be cut in half. The decorations are second to none. We bought tickets from AAA which gave us free parking. If you even think there is a chance you will do Disneyland sometime during the year, do yourself a favor and get the tickets at Costco before they run out. The most reasonable option by far than anywhere else. The food in the park has gotten better, but you are better off going to Downtown Disney to eat. For the same price you can at least get fresh food. You can pack in food and drinks, when our bags were searched for security, not a word was said about food in our bags. ",Disneyland_California

I'm in my late 20s but I feel like I'm 8 years old again when I enter the park and see Sleeping Beauty's castle. **Travel Tip: Go to Disneyland during the off season to avoid the crowds. Avoid visiting in the summer months, during holidays and on the weekends. On a Tuesday in February or early October, you will experience few lines and hardly any stress.",Disneyland_California
571893175,5,2018-04-01,United States,"We only had one day for our family of three to spend at Disneyland. It was $135 per person (our son is 10YO), and we paid $10 extra pp for the FastPass feature on our mobile app. We purchased everything through the mobile app (iPhone) the night before. The mobile app for using FastPass is called MaxPass. We went on a Wednesday morning during spring break which is peak season. Taking the tram from the parking lot to front gates is about 10 15 minutes so factor in that travel time. There was no magic morning at Disneyland that day so the crowds were not too bad when we showed up at 8AM to enter the park. We immediately signed up for a FastPass thru the app (so you don   t have to walk to the ride for a physical FastPass ticket) for one of the major rides (Space Mountain) and began to ride rides that had about a 10 minute wait. I kept on signing up for FastPasses as soon as I could throughout the day. I probably did about 7 FastPass rides and never stood in line more than 15 20 minutes on any ride period. Only 13 Disneyland rides offer FastPass. There was one FastPass ride where we stood about 10 15 min because of equipment issues, but on the whole, the FastPass lines were 0 5 minutes. Another reason for the the FastPass is that we got    free    photos (through PhotoPass on the MaxPass app) from the rides and the professional Disney photographers. They scan your QR code on your app or you enter the photo ID from the ride photo and    voila!    it eventually shows up on your app and you can download the high res photo for your own record (or pay them to print and frame it). We got through most of the rides we wanted to ride by 1PM. It was no warmer than 72 degrees the day we went in early April and cloudy most of the morning   ideal conditions. I highly recommend the fried chicken at the Plaza Inn. We also got the Dole Whip float (near the Tiki Hut in Frontierland) although the line was 10 15 minutes. Hot dog on a stick was good   lots of corn bread though. Funnel cake in New Orleans was OK (too crispy). We wanted to stay for the fireworks but were too tired. Disney does skew toward the younger kids (with things like    Its a small world    type rides). Universal skews more for teenagers. As our son grows older, Disney parks will be less interesting than Universal parks. An awesome day; it ain   t cheap, but worth it for the family fun and memories. The premium you pay for Disneyland is for the cleanliness of the park, professionalism of staff, and overall very high quality of the experience. Disneyland is a finely tuned machine from parking to managing queues.",Disneyland_California
273809607,5,2015-05-01,United Kingdom,"We drove and stayed in a campsite close to Disney as the price of the Disney hotels were quite a bit too expensive.3 hours drive from Calais so not bad at all.10 min drive from the campsite to Disney,   15 to park in the car park, plenty of space and about a mile from the car park to the actual ticket booths.The whole place was magical, we had access passes due to our child having autism, if we had to queue for any length of time we wouldn't have enjoyed it half as much.The rides were amazing, the parades were out of this world and the song  magic everywhere  will stay with you forever.Meeting the characters was amazing also, especially our little boy's favourite Mickey Mouse.The fire works were also amazing, the total experience was just so magical.We ate in the restaurant's there, yes they were expensive but we went to a buffet style so you could eat what you want and catered for all tastes.The whole place was buzzing and it was a dream come to true for us, can't compare it to America as never been but if you are thinking about booking, do it, you will have wonderful time.A magical time was had by all, we were on the go for 14 hours each day but totally worth it, and no one wanted to come home : )",Disneyland_Paris

In addition the food is slightly more expensive but miles better than any other theme park. Why people write these factors on reviews is a mystery but thought I would state the obvious.....The place is magical it's the only holiday destination I have been where I forgot I lived in the real world with a stressful job and completely relaxed and smiled. Seeing my children so happy will stay with me forever and I don't care how much it cost!The parades are amazing and must be seen, the magic show at night is amazing and really needs to be watched   only suggestion would be to make this an hour earlier because hard for a 5 and 2 year old to stay awake till 11pm! The shops are brilliant and the kids loved watching me buy them all the favourite characters. The rides are good and worth the long queues one or two need updating though which I am sure will happen. Go to Buzz pizza world for dinner great value for all you can eat including drinks and dessert 20 euro!

There are the rides, parades, shows, food, snacks, photos with characters and tours. I also recommend to look up fun things to do such as look for the hidden mickeys, look for cats that hide in the back areas and other fun facts around Disney that often get over looked. This place is big and impossible to see experience everything in one day. So you can come often and always have a different experience or stay as long as you can to experience everything during your trip. I suggest to arrive early for the rope drop as crowds are very low at this time.

There is nothing to dislike about the park, maybe with the exception of some rude tourists, but you have that regardless of where you travel. The lines are not too bad during the week, especially when school is still in. Try avoiding the summer if you can, really hot and super crowded.

Never having been to a Park outside the US, I did a lot of reading of reviews and comments. I realized that it wouldn't be Disney World, and I really downgraded my expectations based on what I read. I was completely surprised by my experience at Disneyland Paris. The Park is beautiful. It's smaller than Disney World, but what isn't? I thought the landscaping, the buildings, the restrooms and the rides were extremely well kept up. And in the Parks and hotel, I had nothing but positive interactions with Cast members. So much for the negativity I anticipated.The rides and attractions were a combination of familiar and new. And many of the familiar had different twists. Big Thunder Mountain is much more of a thrill ride, starting with the initial rush under the lake to get to the  mountain . Pirates of the Caribbean is a longer ride with more theming. Star Wars Hyperspace Mountain seemed a bigger thrill ride here. Buzz Lightyear, Star Tours, and It's a Small World were all familiar and well done. A couple walk thrus that were unique were the Sleeping Beauty Castle with Stained glass windows on the balcony, and a dragon in the basement. I also really enjoyed the walk through of Alice's Curious Labyrinth. My only disappointment was that Phantom Manor and the Indiana Jones ride were closed for refurbishment. Lots of the normal Disney option for dining. We enjoyed the Moroccan buffet at the Agrabah Cafe.This Disney Park did not let me down. Go with a positive attitude.

Disney (if you are a parent) is not a day out... its a military operation. How to make sure your kid doesn't wait in a queue for longer than 20 minutes? First arrive before anybody else (my wife and child were ripped from their beds as they are disney virgins..the early bird really does catch the mouse,duck, goofy). So you get in... go straight for its a small world... dumbo... pooh. ok so thats the first 30 minutes and fantasy is almost all over. next its toy story it will take 1.5 hours at worst. Oh no i haven't seen any photos yet you might say..... get real the photos will be there all day. The parades are only 2 deep so kids on shoulders can easily see the parade ( I had a mixed view of a nike t shirt and Disney characters       my daughter got to see the parade and I got to see the smiles and hear the laughter (enough for me)) At 7:30pm went on astro blazers (shooting toy story game) 10 times yes ten times no waiting in line just getting on.... and going on and on and on. Lunch at 2pm no waiting in line. I think i've shared enough secrets but the last thing is be careful .. don't wait till the fireworks if you need to take the MRT its a crush.

Would need two days, minimally, just to walk past all that is inside.I did use the ?multi park tickets, a bit, but, not much need, easiest to stay in one park, first days, then, last days, use Multi park tickets, for your last day or two, only, unless you know the parks, been there before.My first trip, I spent three days, all in one park, and still was not half done with what I might have wanted to do.Expect to pay 45 dollars for lunch for three people, including kids.You can easily carry a back pack around, with water bottle s, and snacks, etc, and, carry the back pack onto rides, easily..I carried the back pack for the whole crew, and, the others carried a mini back pack, and, that worked well: water drinks, snack foods, to delay having to have TWO meals inside the park, ( after having breakfast at Denny's), worked well.The  fast pass  system, is worth looking into, waiting in lines is likely to slow the whole day. Disney has a way of making lines look sorta NOT long, but they wind, roll, twist, and are endless, up, down, all around, but so, you cant see the line is a mile long as you get in one. When they say wait time is 60 minutes, they know it is, they have people tourists, carry something that times it. A Fast Pass, shortens a one hour line to a five q0 min line.Beat the long lines by staying up late: wait times for popular rides are about ten minutes, after ten pm, and, the park is open till at least Midnight.I rode the same 'star wars ride three times, including wait time, from 1130 pm, till midnight. Once in line, even if after midnight, you DO get to ride.Watch for the Parades, worth getting a good spot along the way. The shows, are top notch: live performance, with skilled actors actresses.

From the moment you get off the bus or tram or walk down to the main entrance it begins with those familiar tunes bringing a smile to your face. The park itself is always immaculately clean and the gardens beautiful (never seen a gardener there so I guess it's all done magically ). Let's be realistic though not everything is perfect everyday (rides closed, too crowded etc.) but, and it's easy, you just ignore those things and enjoy yourself and make the most of everything. Serious gripes would be inconsiderate guests with strollers barging through and people in scooters doing the same thing. Some courtesy from these (not all) would make it an even happier place if that was possible. I experienced the Halloween Party on my last visit. It was fantastic. Less crowded with the only queues being for the Haunted mansion and Space Mountain   dark rides that I had visited during the day without the queues, go figure. The new parade and fireworks lived up to expectations. It's nice to see the villains getting centre stage for a change. A great night.

133043708,5,2011-08-01,Canada,"We've been driving down to California from Canada every other summer or so and have been to Disneyland on several different trips. We like to think we are now pros at visiting the park and we have a few tips to share on making the day pleasant.First off, get fastpasses whenever possible. My husband and I will split up to travel the park better and he'll go get fastpasses and we'll wait in line. Some rides are not busy early like Pirates so we'll go on those and save the new rides for waiting in line since they usually don't have a fastpass available. Sometimes we'll head to the park early, leave in the heat of the afternoon to go back to our hotel for a nap or swim, then return in the evening when it's cooler and less busy. People with really small kids, I recommend staying on site and give yourself a day off inbetween disney to chill by the pool. It's hard to watch exhausted little kids have a breakdown at the end of the day because it's too much going 7 days straight. Chill out and take your time.We have an older child so we can travel the park easily without strollers. California Park has bigger faster rides (the roller coaster is the best I've ever been on, so smooth). Everything in Disney is top notch, it is a well oiled machine. It's clean, the staff are great and we always have a blast.People complain about the food. We have found the best way to do disney is to bring our own food and water. We partially freeze water in bottles the night before and then fill and take them with us. They stay cold all day and we never have to buy water. We make sandwiches and bring veggies and fruit. This is much more satisfying to eat than greasy food onsite. We love having our own little picnic at Disney and no one has ever said anything about it. If they ask, I've been told to tell them due to dietary restrictions, you have to bring your own food. We will get treats on site like icecream in downtown disney but we refrain from spending money on trinkets that will end up in a drawer at home. We usually get one small souvenier like an ornament or a t shirt. The Aladin show is great but it's been running for many years and I'm not sure why they haven't put together a new show. That's my only complaint, to update this show. Other than that, the parades are great, world of colour is amazing and the rides are fun, charming and clean. We're so excited to go back down this summer to see the new Cars park.",Disneyland_California

No less than THREE times did we queue for an hour, reaching the front of the queue, only for the ride to break down entirely and the staff to send everyone away without any explanation or compensation. The park seems woefully ill equipped to deal with wet weather (have they not realized that some rides are outdoors?) and is in no way close to being able to deal with large numbers of visitors. We are here in winter, I assume that coming here during peak period is like holidaying in Gomorrah as God burns it down. At the RC Racer, passengers were literally TRAPPED in the vehicle for ten minutes with no staff attempting to explain (see attached picture). Currently in the restaurant having waited twenty minutes in the queue to join the queue.

The rides were enjoyable but are probably better in California adventure but the atmosphere was just great.We found plenty of characters, getting early access was really great, it gave us a head start on queues but also helped us find stuff without the crowds.Our girls wanted pictures with the 'cast' and had makeovers at the bibbity bobbity boutique early (it was actually really good) and meant they had some great pictures. I would recommend the photo pass, watch out though the app shows a daily charges of $39 a day but the website has a week offer of $69 if you are there for more than a day.Things to do:Indiana jonesSplash mountain Star tours (nice break from princesses)Space mountainHaunted mansionPiratesThunder railwayThe rest is ok but some warnings, the Peter Pan ride is always mobbed (45 min average wait time) and it's not very good, I have no idea why it's so busy. The jungle cruise is pretty lame but funny and the 'it's a small world' is just really weird and 20mins of your life plus queue time you will never get back, don't do it!",Disneyland_California

There are rides for all levels of fun and shows that give you time off your feet. The food is expensive. The parades are entertaining. If you want to catch a short line   visit the rides during parade times. ,Disneyland_California
238878735,4,,India,Me and my wife decided to experience the magic of Disney land Paris so we bought a half and half ticket to both Disney land park and Disney studios. And it was worth spending our money on. Booking tickets in advance will be beneficial as you won't have to wait in a long queue plus online booking might have some good discounts too. Both the park and studios have good rides to be on. Remember to start your day early so as to take maximum advantage. Get the map at the entrance and plan your day to not skip the  must do  rides. The parades were very enchanting which gives a true Disney experience. This is a true family theme park for kids of all ages. Don't miss the hotel ride in studios. ,Disneyland_Paris

166365483,2,2013-07-01,United States,"Our family of 5, kids ages 9, 12 and 14 spent 5 days in France. We had the idea that Disneyland Paris would be a way to have a kids day and leave the museums for a bit. Maybe even get away from all the smoking in Paris The parks were nice enough and the rides were nice. Space mountain and crushes coaster are very good. Different than the ones in ca and fl. The people working were nowhere near as efficient as I would expect from Disney. We would see trash on the walk ways, people cutting lines, kids playing frisbee near ride entrances and worst of all, smoking everywhere. It almost seemed like Disney was trying to save money and not hire as many people to maintain crowds and keep the place cleanThe smoking pretty much ruined our experience, I asked one employee who was a manager of an area and he told me that even though there are signs for no smoking all over, they just don't enforce it. It's part of the culture he said.I would not go back again",Disneyland_Paris
264155735,2,2015-04-01,United Kingdom,"Two of us went to the Paris disneyland park over the Easter weekend and had a really disappointing time. Despite focussing on getting on as many rides as possible (we even ate lunch in a queue) we only managed four rides in a full day (three if you don't count the haunted house)! We queued for an hour for Indiana Jones before being kicked off because the ride had broken down, Space Mountain was closed, and we were turned away from Pirates and Thunder Mountain (the first time we tried) because they had temporarily broken down as well!Although the parades were kind of fun, there were no characters walking around, the rides weren't particularly well themed (e.g. the thunder mountain and the haunted house didn't even have disney themes), and so I don't see what Disneyland has over parks that actually have good rides.",Disneyland_Paris

3845337,5,,United Kingdom,"Me and my young family think that Disneyland in Paris is fabulous! We   ve visited it twice now (Easter 2004 and August 2005) and we   ve had a trip to Disney World in Florida in between (Christmas New Year) and I couldn   t honestly say which is better. Sure, Disney World is bigger and it   s all in English but it   s so far away! In my experience both have their positives and negatives.People also say that the weather in Florida is better. Well, it certainly doesn   t get cold in Florida but it can get unbearably hot which can make the Disney experience miserable. I   d much rather have mild warm weather (like you get in Paris in the summer) than soaring temperatures when you   re trying to navigate round a busy theme park. The heat saps everyone   s energy and makes everyone irritable.People also say that Disneyland Paris is expensive but I   d say that   s true about Disney in whichever country you go to. Whether you   re talking about the cost of accommodation, food, snacks or gifts, Disney isn   t cheap but then the experience is second to none and nobody does a theme park like Disney!One thing really going for Orlando is that there is so much to do there (maybe too much?!) and each one of the 4 Disney Parks is fabulous. However, when it comes to Paris there is a major imbalance between the Disneyland Park and the Disney Studios. We struggle to find things to do at the Studios in Paris and if it wasn   t for the Stunt Car Show then it wouldn   t really be worth the visit. This is a massive disappointment because the Disney MGM Studios in Florida is fantastic and needs two days set aside to see everything.When you compare the Magic Kingdom in Florida against Disneyland in Paris then the obvious differences are the size and the language. But then the use of space in Disneyland is phenomenal with so much packed in and they also do try and cater for all languages (English, German, Spanish and French). You do have to remember that you are in Europe. We found that most of the signs were in French with English underneath; most of the staff speak pretty good English (much better than my French!) and that they make a good effort during the shows too. When we went to see the Legend of The Lion King it was entirely in English with French and German shows scheduled for other times during the day. The Winnie The Pooh show was in a mix of French & English and for Honey, I Shrunk The Audience you get a pair of headphones to put on and you can choose your language.Ok, enough of the comparisons because it   s fair to say that its    swings and roundabouts    when you try to compare the two side by side.Each time we   ve been to Disneyland in Paris we   ve stayed there for 4 nights and stayed at the fabulous Disneyland Hotel which sits pride of place right over the entrance to the Disneyland Park which means that you can be in Fantasyland one minute and back in your room 5 minutes later. I   ve written a separate review for the Disneyland Hotel in the appropriate section but I will stress that staying here has made our visits so much more enjoyable.The first thing that strikes you about any Disney Park is how clean it is. Then you might notice the fabulous attention to detail. There really is so much to gaze and marvel at and the flowerbeds, trees and grass are always pristine. Disney really does go out of its way to make the surroundings pleasant and safe.One word of advice (and this applies to everything Disney whether it   s meal times, retiring to bed or getting into the Parks)    THE EARLIER THE BETTER! The best time to be in the Disneyland Park is between opening time (usually 9:00am) and 11:00am, during this time you more or less have the park to yourself and can walk up to any ride and get on pretty much straight away. After 11:00am it does start to get busy. When it gets to noon you should be thinking about lunch because by 12:30 1:00pm everywhere will be packed.We managed to spend the equivalent of 2 full days in the Disneyland Park and we enjoyed everything that we did whether it was Star Tours, Big Thunder Mountain, Pirates of The Caribbean, Honey I Shrunk The Audience, Peter Pans Flight, It   s A Small World, Casey Jr     Dumbo   s Circus Train, Mad Hatters Tea Cups, Carousel, Adventure Island, Dumbo The Flying Elephant, Autopia (speedway), Alice   s Curios Labyrinth and the Pirates Beach.Yes you have to queue sometimes, annoying as it is, but if you do get in early then you can get so much more done before the hoards arrive. I think that every queue that we did encounter stayed moving and we never really became frustrated or fed up.Both of the parades were wonderful but then I   ve yet to see a duff Disney Parade! This Fantalusion Parade which was on at 10:30pm was especially good. Each float is wonderfully lit and this is enhanced by all the lights in the park being switched off as the parade starts. This parade was then followed by the Wishes Firework Display which was nothing short of spectacular and really does fill the sky.Our two kids are aged 7 and 2 and there is much to do here no matter what age you are. There is certainly as much for the little kids as there is for the big kids. Our 2 year old daughter had a whale of a time and still talks animatedly about what she did and saw at    The Disneyland   . We didn   t take our own buggy this time and instead we hired one which is easy to do and costs    6.50 a day. When you take it back you can ask for a receipt so that if you also visit the Studios on the same day (or vice versa) then you can get a stroller without having to pay twice. The buggies also have a useful foot plate on the back for slightly bigger kids to stand on.As I said earlier the Studios Park feels a bit empty when compared to the Disneyland Park. However, the redeeming features are the Stunt Car Show which is awesome (even if there is a bit too much talking in between the stunts), Aladdin   s Flying Carpets and the Studio Tram Tour (complete with Disaster Canyon). I think there   ll be more for us to do here when our kids are a bit older.All in all I cannot fault a trip to Disneyland in Paris especially if you stay at a Disney Hotel (I would definitely recommend the Disneyland Hotel!). There   s always something to do and marvel at, it   s clean and it   s safe. You will find yourself being swept away with it all because it   s truly magical, totally unique, utterly charming and your kids will love you for it!",Disneyland_Paris

16750021,3,,United States,"My husband and I love Disneyland, Anaheim and go at least once a year. While in London on a two week vacation, we decided to invest (yes it cost us that much) in a day trip to Disneyland Paris on the Eurostar. We only had 5hrs in the park. Luckily for us, it wasn   t a busy day and we didn   t have to wait in super long lines. I found that the Disney Experience was lacking. It felt like an amusement park and not the total immersion into the Happiest Place on Earth, I get in Anaheim. It might be attributed to the fact that we only had 5hrs and ran from ride to ride, trying to catch all the differences between the parks. One thing that really bothered us, was that all the indoor rides; Haunted House, Pirates, Space Mtn were hot and stuffy. They definitely needed to turn on the air conditioners! We were there May 7 2008.We are shoppers and love Disney merchandise and were surprised we had a hard time finding something to purchase as a souvenirs. When we go to Anaheim, we struggle picking which of several items to buy. You   d think you could find Mickey related Eiffel Tower   s, but that proved to be quite the chore. We may go back, one day, spend a few days at the resort to give it another chance. Besides, my new favorite rollercoaster is there   .Rock n Roller coaster featuring Aerosmith. Previously my favorite was California Screamin in Anaheim! I have to go back one day! IT WAS AWESOME!",Disneyland_Paris
131732678,1,2011-11-01,United Kingdom,"Visited several months ago but decided to write this review as some friends have just returned from this money grabbing hell hole and have related the same experiences that we met. Basically the French should never have been allowed to get their hands on a Disney franchise because a) they don't like foreigners and as tourists tend to be foreigners they make up the majority of visitors here and thus obviously annoys the staff! b) this Disney park is aimed at the French first, then other Europeans (Germans, Dutch...) c) if you are British you get treated with utter disdain. Try explaining to your six year old child why Goofy pushed him out of the way so the French child could take priority for the photograph   try being a mum and wanting to smack Goofy in front of everyone!!!Basically the operators of this park have not got a handle on how to create a Disney experience complete with smiles, laughter and 'feel good' atmosphere. You resent paying 200 euros for your family to get in to be snarled at, shrugged at and pushed and jostled roughly in the queue you have stood in for over an hour by other people of local nationality. Men are the worst, this is a habit I also discovered exists in a couple of theme parks in Spain. I don't mind queing for whatever time it takes to get on a ride but I get real angry when my children have been patient, stood in line, only to have four loud local teenage girls come from under the barrier and stand in front of them. The attendants say nothing and the pusher ins just give you the 'go back where you came from' glare...Food   overpriced junk. Toilets   filthy, take your own toilet paper if you   like most people   tend to use it...Health and Safety   it is the French habit to smoke everywhere so be prepared to endure the stink   mind your young children's eyes and cigarettes are held down at their eye level...as mentioned in several reviews here...dangerous!!!!Queuing   stand your ground over your place in the queue   you WILL get pushed in front of!Language   speak French...? so do we   but the staff like to pretend you cannot.For these reasons alone I would like to see Paris Disney closed down   or old Walt come back and haunt the hell out of the place! awful awful, awful...and I am sure the attitude of staff would earn them the 'R' label here in the UK.",Disneyland_Paris

281222352,2,2015-06-01,Germany,"From the lady at the ticket counter to the ride operators, and everyone in between, no one was welcoming or friendly. It was so disappointing not to have that magical Disney experience. The staff was rude, the lines were way too long, the bathrooms were filthy, and the number of stores outnumbered the rides 10 to 1. I felt the park was one giant store just trying to get your money rather than a theme park for kids. Waiting in line for a  reservation  to meet a princess was like competing in the Hunger Games. I hardly saw any characters outside of the parade. The Walt Disney Studio was a complete waste of time. It is so small with hardly any rides and the rides they do have were an hour wait. I had two incidents at the park and when I complained to guest services they didn't bat an eye. Sad, sad, sad, that Disney cares so little for its customers.

It was very crowded, but we still managed to do just about all of the rides. It was our son's first time visiting, and he had a really good time.

Next day at Disneyland, again rides closed, long waits, rides breaking down left and right and way too many people! We should have been told more about the parks when we purchased the tickets or even when I called in advance to ask questions. One park is primarily for little kids and the other, unless you pay for the Fastpass app and figure out how to use it quickly, don't waste your time or money going here.

Alot of really bad banging about on space mountain, really sore ears and we both have badly bruised shoulders.Some staff were a bit unpleasant but at the sale time I think we are spoiled having encountered the staff in Florida.

We saw the day parade with the most colorful floats and costumes and also the fireworks show in the evening was spectacular. Downside: check that you're not going in school holidays, it was chaotic to say the least, some lines were an hour wait to go on a ride that lasted 1 minute.

226632538,4,2014-08-01,United Kingdom,"its worth getting tickets for both parks, this and Walt Disney Studios. this is the older park, still has some great rides such as big thunder mountain and Space mountain. we did all of the rides (apart from Star Tours) some quite a few times! even got on the old tugboat. its a shame there is no fast pass for Crushes Coaster, as only managed to get on that one time. we took advantage of the early opening for hotel guests (8am rather than 10am) and although a lot of the park wasn't open yet we did get to go on Peter Pan's magic flight, the tea cups, Buzz Lightyear's Lazer Blast and there is nothing like Space Mountain just after 8am in the morning! if you are staying in a Disney Hotel take advantage of the half board option and book dinners in the various restaurants around the two parks: three course meals with waiter service and not a burger in sight! we went to the Silver Spur Steakhouse and Walt's American Diner, both very good. The Diner was an oasis of calm in a busy park, and then tended to seat families with young children in one part and with older children in another, which seemed to work well for everyone, it definitely beats queueing up for junk food in busy fast food palaces...the show at the end was  pure Disney magic  and the parades are worth seeing !again the park is busy in the summer, so plan your days, take raincoats!, and use the fast pass when you can!",Disneyland_Paris

A one day pass is all that is needed to get around to all the attractions. Only disappointment was the lack of food stalls and the lack of variety. Many stalls were closed.

You get more for your money and Annual pass Perks. Just recently they started an early hour entry to the park of your choice for the summer. But you do have to register.Also discounts on food and Merch and invitations to some disney events they have from time to time.If you are on a budget I recommend bringing an ice chest for drinks and food and buy a locker in the picnic area at disneyland but make sure the ice chest is not to big it needs to fit in locker.They do have different size lockers at a price. Also, what I do to not over spend, I buy a disney gift card at my budget amount so Im not carrying money and credit cards so I don't have that urge to over spend.During the Summer months I freeze bottles of water and put them in a hydration backpack and add snacks. It's easy to carry around and the frozen water keeps your back cool and you don't need to give into buying high price bottled water at the park.On Main Street if you buy coffee at the Market house free Coffee all day just show your receipt for a refill.",Disneyland_California

624436219,4,2018-10-01,United States,"Fun, but super crowded 3 of the 4 days we visited.  Really like the new maxpass option, without it we couldn't have ridden most rides as the wait times were unbearable.  Too bad it's becoming hard to find any low times to visit.",Disneyland_California
603171913,4,2018-07-01,United States,"Went for 3 days and had an excellent time. The weather was  35cTips, take your own water bottles and snacks sandwiches, you'll save a small fortune. The park could do with doubling the amount of water fountains and street vendors. The Disneyland Park I would say is more the adult and Studios more toward the kids side. The shows are good. I would recommend the stunt car, marvel avengers (tip   queuing starts an hour before the performance). Tower Hotel was very good, Aerosmith rollacoaster (very strong g forces), Mickey's magic show (kids loved most of the shows). The Star Wars Hyperspace, Buzz Lightyear, all good. The Star Tours was really good. We went on there 3 times, it's a shame they have 3 or 4 slightly different stories and they played 3 out of the 4 dubbed in French. Warning there is one with JarJar (shudder). Should play them in the original version. More good rides than bad. RC Racer. Thunder Mountain, Indiana Jones etcProbably can avoid (and save time) on Armageddon, Art of Disney. The Studio tram tour not worth the long wait (tip   go at the end of the day with no queue).Tip   some of the rides have single rider queues which appear shorter waiting times, I saw groups of people going into these but the actual queues where quicker. The Crush Turtle one comes to mind. Good ride but no fastpass. The street stalls at the studios were easier to find for food and beer! Queues not big. Overall, staff very nice, shops expensive, you can pre book meetings with the characters (they won't stop and have a picture if they are walking through the park). A little overrated I'd say (maybe the cynic in me)   I think the kids loved the pool in the hotel more! Haha. But it's done and probably won't go back anytime soon. If I do it will be Florida. You will have a good time.",Disneyland_Paris
157066663,5,2013-04-01,United States,Disneyland is always magical and never disappoints.

Dining and entertainment are first class experiences. No one is ever too old to greet Mickey and his entourage.,Disneyland_California

154750309,2,2013-03-01,United Kingdom,"Having stayed at this park five times previously,we have seen how it has deteriorated. There used to be shows and also actors playing out scenes in various locations around the park. Now there is nothing. We stayed 11 13th March when it snowed but no effort was made to clear paths or get rides ready. Lots of attractions were closed or opened late, even the indoor rides. People were walking around wondering what to do with their time. We saw many people slip on the snowy paths. There are an abundance of shops selling overpriced goods in which people were crowded trying to keep warm. The cost of food is ridiculous. We had purchased food vouchers in advance which saved us a little bit of money. I would suggest eating at a restaurant that serves buffet so you can eat as much as you want. The Plaza restaurant was good in the Magic Kingdom as it caters for vegetarians as well. You need to book a time. We stayed at the Newport Bay Club this time. Previously we stayed at the Santa Fe. Our room was nicely decorated but a double bed is a little small for us as neither my husband or myself sleep that well. Our granddaughter enjoyed having a bed all to herself though. The swimming pool was too cold to play around in. We ate breakfast at 7.30am. Any later than this and you would have to queue. It was good to be shown to a table and to keep going back to the buffet. At the Santa Fe we had to get all the food at one go and then find our own table. Drinks were really expensive in the bar. We won't be going back to disneyland Paris again I don't think.",Disneyland_Paris

So its time to see what the  original  parks do look like.There were no promotions available,so adult tix is 87usd...for sure not cheap (considering what you actually get inside the park, i would say its overpriced)! I went there on a week day, avoiding the weekend crowd, but it was still well packed. This park is just opposite the Adventure park, where u will find more fun and thrill rides. The disneyworld is something for young and old. Although it was not as impressing as i thought,perhaps its the lack of excitement,because its already the 4th park (however, its really more a place for the very young...not really the adult fun place, which should be on the adventure side).The food and drink inside the park isnt cheap, so you may take some own supply.",Disneyland_California

Later on we waiting for a bus for three quarters of an hour only to be told we could have walked thro the park to our hotel in 10 mins.

It's still a great place to be. The most obvious change observed is the extra security with the bag checks but this was to be expected. No major delays resulted. Unfortunately it was Spring Break and the people lining up to go on the rides confirmed this. It was not unusual to see wait times of 120 minutes for certain rides. But as I mentioned above, people were still smiling and happy.Great week there, loved it.",Disneyland_California
326475927,2,2015-10-01,United States,"We came from out of state for the Halloween Party, a special event for us as we have always wanted to visit the Haunted Mansion with Jack Skellington in residence.That was a great moment, seeing the mansion and the ride was fabulous.The crowds were massive on a Friday night, especially between 4 7pm when the daytime visitors are in the park and the doors open for the party goers. There are rope lines set up to help with lines into the rides and handing out candy. With the crowds as huge as when we went, we watched as people were blocked off by massive crowds on one side and no way to get out due to the crazy rope lines on the other, people started to panic down by the haunted mansion area, going under the rope lines to escape and only to get berated by park employees for  cutting in line  , ridiculous! It took 45 minutes to get a bag of popcorn, the soda we waited 15 minutes to buy ran out of syrup. We had dinner at the Blue Bayou and had to wait a half an hour beyond our reservation time. The Pirates ride, Thunder Mountain AND Indian Jones ALL broke down at the same time in the same area of the park, that did not help with crown control AT ALL. The young people working in the park are simply not trained to handle crowds like this either. Customer service overall slips, as everyone appears to fall into survival mode including employees. It was crazy, we left early. Conversely, we have had a GREAT time at the Halloween party in WALT DISNEY WORLD.We all came away thinking this park is too small for these size crowds, and that the customer service in general was not even close to being on par with what we have always received in Florida. This visit hurt our perception of the Magical Disney experience, big time. We are hoping this is a one off event, but it has tarnished our feelings about Disney overall, believe it or not. We are DVC members, we love going to WDW in Florida. We just can't get over how California Disney leadership and management didn't plan better. You know, it's like this is not supposed to happen at a Disney park. You are supposed to feel safe, happy and carefree. Yikes!",Disneyland_California

314662897,4,2015-09-01,Saudi Arabia,"This park is just like any other Disney amusement parks with almost all the rides that are available in any Disney park but it was not as fun as the other ones; it lacks the fun spirit. I used to hate the long lines that are stick with all Disney Parks that I have visited before but when I visited this one and almost did al the rides that we like in no time (waiting time for Space Mountain was only 5 minutes), I discovered that some of the good part were the queue lines and the big number of happy people around you. Moreover, the music around the park is too dull and you cannot live the moment like what you do in other Disney parks. it is very difficult to have a taxi after the park is closed; it will be better if you leave before the closing time or rely on the metro train for the transportation. We did not see Disney characters going around the park like other Disney parks except one time when we just arrived and unfortunately, they left before we had a chance for our kids to shake hands and have some autographs.",Disneyland_HongKong

It's worth a few extra days so you can revisit your favourites over and over. Take time to notice all the fun things around, decor etc etc. The security now to get into these parks was great, after all who doesn' t want to be safe in this day and age . It was done in a friendly efficient manner, both at CA and DL entrances, although the main gate could do with a couple more metal detectors at peak times as all lines converged. Its great to stay within walking distance, can then just go back for a rest and refresh etc.  My iphone would not pick up wi fi so unfortunately could not get Max Pass, which meant running back and forth to get fast passes. After fireworks if you want to get to Fantasmic you will have walk around the long way through Frontierland, so leave time for this or do on separate nights. ",Disneyland_California

Durign the summer, the lines are too long. The wiat time for a ride that was like 1 minute long, was at least 70 minutes.Was it worth the cost? I doubt it. Newport Bay Club is supposed to be 4 star. But the place is like a market, I tell you. The number of people at the check in, at the bus...The staff try their best I guess.

The character meet and greets were a good touch even if they queues were quite long.The disappointment was the park   it   s not fair comparing it to USA Disney but it falls so far short it   s incredible. We came for meet and greet with Captain America which relies on an App to book....it is impossible to book anything on the app. So basically, the feature attraction is unattainable. Complaints about this are dismissed by customer service staff out of hand. In general staff are not Disney standard   very little is done to answer questions or deal with issues and there is certainly no evidence of going above and beyondThe choice of attraction is ok, though availability of Fast Pass is poor.

187519300,3,2013-12-01,United States,"As my boyfriend and myself were out to venture a wonderful day at our favorite beloved location, we were terribly disappointed. It was about noon as we had started to develop an appetite so i decided to call The Thunder Barbecue Ranch Restaurant and make a reservation. I had looked up the phone number online and called and had a nice conversation with the cast member. I had asked if it was All You Can Eat as I could recall from my last visit years ago, and she replied, Yes, Its $10 per person. She had explained to me the possibility of a cancellation fee and had asked for my card number to set the reservation on. I cheerfully explained to her that my boyfriend and my self were happy to find this place for its cheap price and our extremely small budget considering that we're college freshmen around Christmas time, shopping for our families soon. Our budget for food for the entire day was $20. So around our reservation time, we had arrived and sat at a table. We received no menus except the dessert menu. We ate the delicious food and had a small talk with the other group seated at our table. We had explained to them what the cast member on the telephone had communicated to us of the $10 per person, drinks included in the All You Can Eat, and the desserts were excluded, etc. As the waitress appeared, the other group had inquired about it and the waitress had informed us that the food was $24.99 per person and the cancellation fee was $10 per person. We were absolutely upset about our new findings. We had explained to the waitress of what we were told and how we only had a certain amount of money for the rest of the day and our budget. We were so upset because of the miscommunication and that we unknowingly had spent about $50. The waitress was wonderful and expressed her apologies for the misunderstanding and had tried to see what she could do for us. At the end of the lunch, she had told us  Sorry. They said that the price was displayed on the website too and we can't do anything about it.  I had told her that I had only searched for the phone number and intended to ask more information during the phone call of which i was misinformed. She still said there was nothing she could do. After this, my boyfriend and myself found ourselves broke. We had barely enough to pay for the dinner and our day was ruined. We intended to only spend $20 on food and no money on anything else. We ended up spending $50 that day and my boyfriend found out he lost his job on the same day. We later went to city hall to graciously tell our story and to explain of our misunderstand and the miscommunication of the cast member who made the reservation. The cast member at city hall took my name and said he was going to listen to the phone recording and see what happened. So he went to the back room and we waited about 20 minutes. He came back out and told us that he had talked to the woman who was on the phone with us and she had told him that she established the price and the $10 person was only the cancellation fee. He told us there was absolutely nothing to do for us. He was a very ignorant and arrogant worker who had no intention of helping from the very beginning. We left city hall for 20 minutes or so seeing as how we were greatly upset by the horrible customer service as I perfectly remembered the conversation with the woman. I specifically told her that we were on a low budget and happy to hear of somewhere inexpensive to eat, this was right after she expressed the price was $10 person of which i understood was the buffet cost. I thought it over and remembered how the city hall cast member said he would listen to the phone recording but later came back and said he had only spoke to her and she said she had established the $24.99 buffet fee. We went back and had asked him to listen to the recording, he said  We don't record our phone calls.  and I called him out on telling us that he was going to listen to the recording. We also told him how we told the woman of our low budget after she told us the fee. He had said  Yes she told me that but I didn't think I should bring it up.  He went back to his supervisor to see what could be done but when he came back, he explained that there was nothing they could do and that the woman said she explained the fee. There was no menu to display the buffet fee, and nobody had bothered to explain it as we entered the Thunder Barbecue Ranch. Now my review is not solely based on the lack of display of the buffet fee but particularly to the horrible customer service. As it is supposed to be  The Happiest Place on Earth , they did absolutely nothing to ensure us of continuing our day to be a good day at the park. He was very arrogant, lied about listening to the phone call, and offered nothing for our horrible experience. Im very disappointed as a huge SoCal Disney fanatic, I will have to say that I'm not sure of another trip to the park even after my 100 or so visits. It is easy to see that the business is all about money and this place does not stand by  The Place where wishes come true  or  The customer is always right  I was not requesting a refund at all. A discount for the miscommunication would have been fine or anything to make our day better after the disappointment but this was never the City Hall cast members intention. Very disappointed and I hope he gets fired. He was not an appropriate worker for a place that assures customer satisfaction.",Disneyland_California

So I bought 3 tickets (276 dollar) online and went there the 19th august 2013. The crowd was huge but this we expected. What bothered me the most, was that two of the major attractions were off that week (they should mention this on their website or at least give a discount if they would be honest). We took a fastpass for the splash mountain but it wasn't working when we arrived. We returned after an hour and finally got on it. But while being in the attraction, it broke down and they had to evacuate us. Consolation price : a fast pass for another attraction...Because of this, the fast pass lines elsewhere became long as well (min. 30 min of waiting).

There were a few rides such as Big Thunder Mountain closed for refurbishment, but I guess they have to do it sometime. My top tips would be if you can go on weekdays it is much quieter than on the weekend. If you are watching Disney Dreams Fireworks you need to be facing the castle, so stand half way up main street. Disney scenes are projected onto the front of the castle, after Lion King section and when Peter Pan starts if you want a sharp exit start making for the exit and shuttle bus if you want to avoid the mad rush as everyone tries to leave at the one time. There is a great ice cream shop on main street, quite reasonable pricewise too and we ate at the restaurant next to Buzz Lightyear where they do the Jedi training again not too bad pricewise and lots of seating. Last top tip 're fastpass system. If you have a fastpass say 10.30 to 11 return time. If it's after 10.30 you can get another fastpass from an adjacent ride before you ride using your fastpass.",Disneyland_Paris

238249432,3,2014-10-01,United Kingdom,"This review applies to the Disneyland Park and Disney Studios.We LOVE Disney, and over the years have been to Paris and Orlando on a few occasions. Haven't been to Paris for a while and we were quite disappointed this time. The Disney spirit seems to be lacking somehow. When we've been in the past there have been characters all over the parks for photo or autograph oportunities. You would be walking along and suddenly see someone. Previously there has been several pricesses, CHip n Dale, Buzz n Woody, Goofy, Pluto, Minney, etc. etc. all around the park, all day you could see someone somewhere. But this time the only characters we saw were Mickey (in his normal place with a queue), Goofy (once) and Jack Skellington (once). Thats not much Disney for two parks in two full days : Also disappointing was the frequent ride malfuntions. As we were there at half term, to save time we planned our days and headed straight for busy rides at opening. Day one headed straight for Indianna Jones   technical problems, so had to go elsewhere and join the back of other queues! Day two headed straight for Rattatoui   technical problems! (As we were near the front of this queue we decided to stay put, as thought it would be quicker to wait for them to fix the ride than to join a 2 hour queue later in the day. Ride eventually opened about an hour after park opening   frustrating!). Also on day 1 Pirates of the Caribbean was closed when we went and had to return the following day to ride it. **They don't seem to have these unscheduled ride closures in Orlando.The parade in Disneyland Park was really good as always, and we thoroughly enjoyed the nightime show on the castle. Definitely worth staying out for (or coming back for if you've popped out for dinner). All in all I think Disneyland Paris is slipping, and I'm not sure I'll be back anytime soon.

184219850,5,2013-07-01,United Kingdom,"Having never been before I was certainly worried by the bad reviews here but was pleasantly suprised! My family agreed the food was fairly reasonably priced and was really delicious. We ate at the cascadeurs, hakuna matata, fuente del oro, caseys corner and cafe hyperion. A good variety of foods were on offer and were really delicious! The queues were fairly long but the advertised times were true and the lines were beautifully decorated. We went in the middle of the summer holidays but never felt like it was crowded or the wait times were too long. The place was beautifully presented with vibrant colours and amazing scenery! We found the staff to be very polite and helpful when walking around a lot of cast members waved with a cheery bonjour and commented on my pin badges! The parades were magical and the night time spectacular was amazing! We found lots of characters walking around who were lots of good fun dancing and playing with the children! I would highly reccomend the riverboat cruise around thunder mountain, the queue wasnt too long and on the lower deck it was so peaceful and relaxing. Calming music was played as you slowly drifted around, even the ducks swam along side the boat!Overall, a truly magical experience! ",Disneyland_Paris

Lost my 3 yo 3 times that day because there were a lot of people but luckily found! Bought my online tickets online as my parents were HK residents and got a little discount. Got the wrong tickets but  guest relations  refunded me when I got there so was very happy. Food was yummy although we ate at 2pm so skipped the crowds. ",Disneyland_HongKong

340630939,3,2016-01-01,United Kingdom,"My husband and I visited the park over New Year with my son and his family. We had bought a package that included the Eurostar Train and Newport Bay hotel.Transport was excellent I can't really fault that. The hotel was fine, we were not in it that much.Things got off to a bad start upon arrival at the park where very little help was available for locating our hotel. We ended up walking through a security checkpoint and part of the park to get to the hotel with a long walk. Quite difficult with luggage and two small children. Upon arrival at the hotel and a long winded check in we made our way to our rooms. These were quite nicely furbished, comfortable for our three night stay. Comfortable bed with nice pillows. No tea coffee making facility though! A TV that we did not use, multi function plug sockets in the dressing table which were a good idea. The hotel is being refurbished at the moment so there was scaffolding outside our window, these had plastic coverings so no view over the lake or balcony access. The rooms were like ovens and my son was unable to open any windows. Thankfully our windows opened. Breakfast was included, a fairly basic continental style selection but adequate.The park itself is quite a walk from the hotel there are shuttle buses available but we chose to walk to save the scrum of getting on a bus. Entry to the park was through a security checkpoint where bags were scanned. Initially I thought the park kind of resembled Disneyland Florida but on a smaller scale however I soon came to realise the inefficient French Disney was a bit of a disappointment. My biggest criticism was that no one seemed to care. It was unfriendly, not the same atmosphere as Florida. The place was rammed with people. Queuing was long for everything with some very short rides at the end of it. Thunder Mountain was closed but most others were running if you had the patience to q for an hour and a half or more. There were rides for little ones but considering the amount of queuing and the short rides it was quite difficult to keep them entertained. There were parades that took place and were quite good and in the evening a light show and fireworks over the Castle were very effective. It all had the same content but on a much smaller scale. One of the things that was disappointing was the lack of Disney characters around. They made appearances in defined areas where you could q to have a photo with them but none wandered around. There was a meet the Princess visit for which a massive q had to be passed through to get a photo with one. I felt that the place lacked the  Disney Magic  that I had felt in Florida. All in all the children did enjoy the visit perhaps me as the adult and having been to Florida noticed the shortcomings more so. If unable to travel to Florida I guess its the best of a raw deal.",Disneyland_Paris
279124019,5,2015-05-01,Australia,"Ok so it's Disneyland. What more do you want to know?If you've been to California Disney   think a more compact version, but still with quite a range to keep you entertained.We visited mid week and although it was a very warm day there was enough shade and cool places so we didn't find the heat a real problem.Quiet when we arrived shortly after opening and it became busy by lunchtime but certainly nowhere near crazy packed. This made most rides only a short wait ( 20 min) and so managed to repeat many rides and get around everywhere in a day. I think one day at this park would be plenty in most circumstances.Come early if there are specific rides you want to do more than once. Autopia queues get very long early, move slowly, and have a lot of families.If you're a thrill ride junkie you're probably going to be disappointed   this is not Universal. But if you're expecting the Disney experience, then it's a great day.Quite a few restaurants were closed (off peak?) so we found the eating choices a bit ordinary and in fact was part of our decision to leave early before the fireworks.The metro connections are easy although it will still take a while to get there. The last metro ride is purely Disney and it helps to put you in the mood as it's themed.I thought the ticket price was good value given all the included rides and live entertainment.",Disneyland_HongKong

The parks are immaculate, Main Street USA is simply beautiful. We were there mid week outside of school holidays, the park wasn't crowded at all, we were able to walk straight onto many of the rides, the longest we had to queue was 20minutes. There really is something for all ages here. Tons of characters walking around that we were able just to walk up to and get a photo with. The Parades and firework show's are mind blowingly spectacular! THe food and drink is very expensive but we had a full board meal package and the food we had in the restaurants was to die for.

274941006,5,2015-05-01,India,We were short of time and couldn't enjoy it thoroughly. The place is great as usual but my grouse is that at some places they had Mandarin and we had to leave those attractions since no English translation was available. People should be told that special passes are given early in the morning and hence we couldn't take part in many places since we arrived late in the afternoon. Again the choice of food is biased towards the Non Vegetarian and those who are vegeterians are left high and dry. They need to address these issues to make it more customer friendly. Not much of shade around the walkways. ,Disneyland_HongKong
554065542,2,2018-01-01,Canada,"We had hoped we had picked a less busy time to visit the park, after Jan. 10. Surprise   by midday it was packed, by late afternoon didn't even feel safe to be there and keep track of 4 kids. Without the Fastpass Program, we would have spent thousands of dollars to be there and would have accomplished very little. Getting there early, which we did, is a must as you can hopefully get in one lineup for a desired ride without using your Fastpass. Visually the sites are amazing, but on Day 2, you want to maximize your ride potential, which is almost impossible given the throngs of people and the long lineups. The parts of the Park we enjoyed the most were the parts that were most empty in the morning. We'd also bought a 3 Day Park Hopper Pass, but discovered the only way to get from one to the other was to go through the main gates again, so suffering lineup fatigue we didn't do that. We did have high hopes for the one Early Morning Magic Pass Day, but discovered that most of the rides the kids wanted to go on were not operational that early and they were grumpy from being woken up early. Also no fireworks, not sure if that's standard for January or because of the California fires, but it was disappointing. Yes we did have fun, and the kids were amazed, but as a destination when you invest a lot of time and a lot of money it was disappointing.",Disneyland_California

However, the day we went to DL park, it was raining that morning and there was no crowd until lunch. We walked on every ride that morning. We walked on the following rides in this order with no line: Space Mountain (plus a Fast pass for later), Matterhorn, Nemo Subs, Small World Holiday, Thunder Mountain (plus a Fast pass for later), Splash Mountain, Winnie the Pooh, Pirates of the Caribbean, Haunted Mansion Holiday, and then Indiana Jones. All before our 12:30 lunch at Blue Bayou. Then the lines were REALLY long. The rain is awesome for riding rides, but it also makes the experience less magical because you miss all the characters and fun stuff on Main St when it opens. The other thing that bothered me was that we couldn't walk through the castle because of shows and parades...it was closed off the entire time. Lot's of cool magic missing on this trip, but hey we got to ride Space Mountain 4 times.",Disneyland_California

153843390,5,2013-03-01,Trinidad and Tobago,"We have two daughters ages 9 and 7, and had a magical time at HKDL. We visited to celebrate my daughter   s birthday and mine. The staff was overly friendly and always eager to wish us happy birthdays. Yes a few had some choppy English, but given they know more English than I know Mandarin or Cantonese, I was more than grateful.Looking at the map, we counted about 15 or 16 true rides. Yes, it   s not as big as Florida or California, but for us there is some advantage to it being smaller   less walking! You can easily see and do everything you want in a day, and in two days it is absolutely pressure free. Just relax, show up at the park, leisurely stroll around and see the attractions you want. Our two day tickets for a family of four were about $200 US. Way cheaper than what you   ll pay in the States. Adding a second day was only about $40 extra for the whole family.We stayed Friday through Sunday nights at the Hong Kong Disneyland Hotel (more on that in our hotel post). It   s about a 20 minute taxi ride from the airport at a cost of about $25 US. We went to the park on Saturday and Sunday. Overall, there really wasn   t much in the way of lines or waiting. Typical wait time was 5 to 20 minutes, except for Autopia 60 minutes and Pooh 45 minutes. I understand Pooh being long with kids and all, but Autopia? Only thing I can think of is that fewer folks have or drive cars in HK, so getting that experience is fun. Second day we went straight to Autopia as soon as the park opened and got it done for our girls.To break things up and potentially avoid the busiest time at the park, we went to downtown Hong Kong mid day on Saturday. Worked out beautiful. Park in the morning, city in the afternoon, and then back to the park for some line free rides for a couple of hours just before the fire works. As a general note, it seemed like after the 3:30 parade there was a large group of folks exiting.All said, would we go back? Sure, if we   re missing some Disney. It   s close to us in Perth, cheaper than traveling to the US or Japan, and two days versus spending a whole week at Disney feels about right.One last tip, if staying at the HKDL Hotel it is only about a 10 minute walk (we timed it) to the park entrance where Mickey is surfing the whale   s water spout. You can take the bus, which will take just about as much time.Oh and before I forget, we really did not witness any of the line cutting others have complained about. I   m guessing it exists for major holidays when the crowds swell, but for the two days we were there we did not have one bad experience.",Disneyland_HongKong
612552280,5,2018-08-01,United Kingdom,Went to both parks for 2 days and we had a great time it was very busy as expected but as we were with a young child we didn   t get the fast pass tickets as the younger rides didn   t have as long of a wait time. The parks really are magical and fun for all ages the parade and fireworks are really good and worth the wait for them. We got the meal plan plus half board tickets for meals you get 1 meal per day and was really good value. Lots of food places and stalls selling snacks they are expensive but to be expected. The shuttleBus is handy but can get very full and can Be dangerous with people pushing when the park shuts at night more buses should be put on at busier times.

The staff   unsmiling, rude, uncaring, unhelpful and seriously in need of Customer Service training. The park   tired looking and dirty in places with litter freely blowing around. The organisation on some rides is just appalling with open entry and exit gates at the same time allowing queue jumping and general mayhem. The food   astronomically expensive and of a very poor standard with junk food the order of the day across the park. We spoke to some Americans who had been visiting Paris and decided to spend the day here. They were horrified and couldn't believe the difference between U.S. parks and here. We have been to the U.S Disney parks on many occasions and the difference is truly remarkable. Why Disney chose Paris (actually it's not Paris as that city is a 50 minute train ride away), I simply can't understand their decision. Clearly the french organisation is incapable of delivering friendly, caring and value for money service in a clean and efficiently run amusement park. All i can say about those reviews praising Eurodisney on tripadvisor, is that the reviewers themselves have never been to the U.S Disney parks and therefore have nothing to measure the service against.

505362959,4,2017-07-01,Ireland,Although I and my family enjoyed our trip to Disneyland Paris. There were a number of points that let the experience down.1) Disney characters. These are in very short supply in the park. No characters walking around interacting with guests. You either queue often for up to 90 minutes for a photo 30 second meeting or do without.On our first day directly after entering the park as our excited little girl ran towards Goofy we were informed bluntly  No.Closed .This was at 10.30am Sterile.2) Fastpass. What is the point? Approached multiple rides with 60 minute  queue times well before lunchtime on different days only to be instructed there were no more fastpass tickets available that day.3)Some of the in park restaurants just close at some random time with no prior warning.I maybe would visit again but definitely in the off season in the hope of actually getting to experience more. Although I'm guessing if after 25 years these little things still arent right we may be better off saving to go to Florida instead.,Disneyland_Paris
172106721,5,2013-08-01,United States,"It was really wonderful to finally visit the original Disney location! I am glad I finally got to see it! It is similar but also very different from the Disney  Orlando experience! One thing this is very different is that there is not nearly the amount of land space as they have in FL, so there are two parks (Disneyland and Disney's California Adventure) and their Downtown Disney all compact and right next to each other in Anaheim. There is one security line you go through for all three, and once inside you then can go right into Disneyland, left into Disney's Californa Adventure, or straight into Downtown Disney...very convenient for park hopping. The parking is all offsite but they have shuttles, or if you are staying in any of the number of hotels that are nearby, it is a short walk. The admission system is not as modern as Disney World (no fingerprint machines) and the staff are not as cheery. Disneyland itself had many familiar rides of the same name, but most of them were actually different, Pirates of the Caribbean was much longer and incorporated some different scenes, Its A Small World   the original is much longer also and really amazing! The Enchanted Tiki Room is the orginial and much better than the Iago (from Aladdin) rendition they have in Disney World. They still have Mr. Toad's Wild Ride at Disneyland and also Snow White   both of which they have replaced at Disney World. I am very glad they have preserved some of the original rides. The Jungle Boat ride is better at Disney World. They still have a submarine ride too! Disneyland also had other rides and attractions that were new. Disney's Califormia Adventure was interesting and fun! New different fun rides here, but also combined some that are found in the other Disney Parks in Orlando like Soarin also in Epcot, Tower of Terror also in Hollywood Studios).

We   ve been to the Florida one so many times and had to check this one out. Only downfall is I don   t understand how people from out of town make a vacation out of it due to the prices. A one day park hopper pass with fast pass added for 3 people was around $600. That   s insane.

No Disney character was walking around to greet the children, not enough places to seat around the park, no french food at all!

Also, I have tried to get into the restaurant at the Pirates of the Caribbean many times when visiting DL and no one has ever told me that you can go online to make reservations. I thought trying to make a reservation two days before would be a guarantee and I was wrong! I asked the hostess what the secret was of getting a reservation and she said to go online a month or so before visiting and make a reservation. But all in all, we love Disneyland and of course would recommend it highly, *Just a little reminder for the adults with children. They are more tired than you are, so please don't yell at them when they whine, dawdle or cry. I saw so many tired parents breaking their little one's hearts with their yelling, scolding and criticizing.

The food options are better these days, and the Faspass is a great feature you can manage on your phone for ten bucks more. I would say the only thing that has gone downhill over the years is the staff attitude. I never used to be able to tell that the staff were over their jobs, and this trip I definitely felt more like the herded cattle of bored farmers. No on gets into their roles anymore. It   s too bad. I can imagine it   s hard to keep a smile on, but apparently they do try to switch people around regularly and give lots of breaks to keep them fresh. Do stay for the fireworks. Worth it. Also, kids can ride pretty much any ride from a young age, so even though we don   t have kids we thought that was pretty cool for other families.

Some details have gone downhill lately, little things maybe most wouldn't notice. Lighting out in some of the rides, some things had been rubbed to the point of deterioration, dirt on things etc. Walt was a perfectionist and wouldn't open a ride if it wasn't 100%. The employees have lost that luster and smile attitude too.",Disneyland_California

314660082,5,2015-09-01,Australia,"We had 10 day passes, which makes each day about $40Aus. We did 9 days between each park. Both are great, and Disneyland is soooo much fun. It doesn't matter your age, you just have a great time. There are so many things to do and see that in the 9 days, we still missed out on some things, but it's easy to get around and do those you love. So may rides and parades to suit anybody, and lots of happy families together. You shouldn't have to wonder if it's worth going to Disneyland, just how many days you want to do!!",Disneyland_California
580857180,5,2018-05-01,Switzerland,"We stayed for 3 days 2 nights and thoroughly enjoyed the magic of Disney. The park is well maintained, clean and amazing. Of course there were lots of people, but this was expected. The waiting time at different rides was ok (10   30 min). It's probably much higher during summer. Unfortunately the weather wasn't the best, but we nevertheless enjoyed our stay. The parade was great, the staff in general was very friendly. The variety of food offered at the restaurants could be better, but we didn't expect anything else (usual food at parks). I have both visited Disneyworld and Disneyland in the USA and it comes very close. All in all a very nice experience I wouldn't want to miss.",Disneyland_Paris

Shows were great, as were the rids. The cast members are so nice and helpful! Took our kids who are 5 and 10 and they were the perfect ages. My 5 year old loved Tower of Terror and Space Mountain. My 10 year old loved Jedi Training Academy...and got picked to participate! All of the food in the park is overpriced, of course, but they let you bring in bottled water which is a big plus! We ate outside the park so can't comment on the food. It was very clean. Fast Pass system is very easy to get the hang of, and I highly recommend using it! All of the lines seemed to move quickly and I'm happy to say most are in the shade or at least have some shade in the queue. They have thought of everything here! I hope we get to go back again!!!",Disneyland_California
448366928,4,2016-07-01,United States,"This was the first time I've ever been Disneyland & there are several things I wish I had known before we arrived. Our first morning was rough! We got there & stood in line to get our bags checked (security check point) then went to the line to go in (nobody told us we had to trade in our paper tickets for real ones) so I got sent to stand in that line just to find out I needed my Drivers License which I left at the hotel because I didn't realize I would need it (thinking I had the  tickets ). We walked back to the hotel just to get it then had to stand in all 3 lines again with toddlers. Once we FINALLY got inside everyone was tired & annoyed. After about an hour & only one ride we gave up & went to take a nap. The Disney characters are only out for about 15 20 minutes at a time. So if you see them get in line quick. Go as soon as the doors open if you want to ride anything! Our second day we got there early & rode lots of rides! The light parade & fireworks are magical. (If there is any wind they won't do the fireworks) The princesses rarely come out but we finally found them in the back, there is a house where you can stand in line to get pics with like 4 of them. This trip was a mess. But we had fun & next time we'll be better prepared! Definitely take food & drinks with you! They check your bags but never said anything about our water bottles & snacks. We've never ate at the park the prices are insane. We'll go again someday. :)",Disneyland_California
163663465,5,2013-05-01,United Kingdom,"Not a cheap day now   $125 a person for the two parks, but still worth it. One thing that annoys me is that you can never see what rides are closed for refurbishment on line. Why don't Disney manage your expectations before you get there? My wife was devastated that Big Thunder Mountain was closed.We visited on a Tuesday in mid May, so it wasn't too busy. short lines for everything.We really love California Adventure.  Soarin' over California  is almost worth the entrance fee by itself, although the big attraction we had come 5,500 miles to see was worth the trip   Cars Land (Radiator Springs) was wonderful. Full of the usual high design standards and little Disney Pixar jokes. Had to wait in line for an hour to go on the big ride, but it did not disappoint.",Disneyland_California

Obviously in the middle of spring break crowds are ALWAYS a challenge. So the trick is to plan in advance what rides you want, use your fast passes and get there as early as possible to beat the crowds. I typically get anywhere from 22 to 25 rides in any visit at the park so planning is everything if you don't want to spend the entire time just standing in lines.",Disneyland_California

This time was a bit disappointing though because they were doing renovations Down Main St., Disney and leading up to the castle so it was all blocked off. The biggest disappointment was there was no parades or fireworks any of the nights we were there and we were there for eight nights.

I gave him the option of leaving and going back to the hotel for a beer anytime he liked. He stayed all day all three days and said he would come again.Disney is expensive, it can be crowed, and it is a lot of walking.But Disney is Disney! All they do is over the top!

The most memorable was the visit to Disneyland where my kids were amazed and thrilled to see their favorite characters come to life. They especially loved meeting the princesses and other characters. The day was magical almost unreal but it was real right from the 5 D theatre to the boat ride and the best ride was the train ride around the place with magnificent views. The highlight was the parade and I think my kids will remember that day for the rest of their lives. Great fun and lots of memories.,Disneyland_HongKong

It's expensive, lines were long (even to get into the park), but can't wait to go back again.Tips to keep cost down: If you can't or don't want to spend a fortune on hotels, most good neighbor hotels are reasonable and offer shuttle service to park. Staying offsite you can often getfree breakfast and order a pizza for dinner or even go to some of chains nearby PF changs, Cheesecake factory. I recommend if you can 4 5 day park hopper. Allows you to leave if it's real crowded, but always go back for the shows at night.World of Color, Fantasmic, Fireworks are all amazing. Get Mousewait on Android or Iphone. Great app that give more accurate ride times and even has wait times for food.It truly never gets old and the worst part is after fighting all the crowds, spending money,etc, is that you have to leave.",Disneyland_California
349404522,3,2016-02-01,United Kingdom,"Just got back and was a bit disapointed with the amount of rides and concessions that were closed in the park. On one day a whole land was out of action due to various refurbs and breakdowns. We are lucky that we have been to florida many times and have been on most things already but it was still unacceptable. Magic hour was a bit of a joke with only 4 rides open on one day all of them infant rides, I agree with other posts about food outlets not being fully staffed and massive queues for just a cup of coffee. The light show on the castle is fantastic even i was impressed with that one shame the closures around the park affected the rest of the visit.

223604857,4,2014-08-01,United Kingdom,We were able to spend one day at EuroDisney   it is impossible to see everything in one day so would suggest booking for 2 or 3 days or making sure that you plan your trip carefully to make sure that you see do everything that you want while you are there.The queues for some of the rides food took well over an hour so be prepared for a long wait.The queues to buy tickets were also extremely long but this could have been reduced if they had open more tills. There are countless amounts of tills at the entrance but only a handful were open   this was very frustrating!We booked tickets for both parks but felt that the Disneyland Park was much better than Disney Village. I would still recommend buying tickets for both parks as the additional cost for the 2nd park is minimal when booking at the same time.,Disneyland_Paris

Nothing beats going to the Disneyland in Anaheim. Being the original Disneyland, this park just has so many things to take in and do, even if you aren't a ride enthusiast. The Fireworks and Light and Colour Show are awesome, as is the parade, although thats better at the 5.30pm session as its night and more lights and flash at this time. It was really cool to be there at Xmas New Year time as everything is Xmas themed, and has a whole new feel to it. Its really fun to go around and meet all the characters from your favourite childhood shows and just experience the magic of Disneyland.

646691969,5,2019-01-01,United States,As a child I only visited Disney World and not Disneyland. So we had time to actually go by Disneyland during a quick weekend trip to Los Angeles. It was easy to enter the gates and have your purse checked and the lines went pretty quickly. They do not let you do an advanced fast pass before you were at the park but I found there were a lot of options or we could do the fast pass once we got there. It was a little difficult to navigate the park because fantasyland had the castle part closed and it made it difficult to try to figure out how to go around it. I think you expect when you go to Disneyland to see the castle so that was a little bit disappointing. Also I found that it   s a small world ride was still playing the Christmas music with Christmas decorations. Since we are mid January I would think that you could work to get it changed over by that point. Overall I enjoyed the visit to the park I still think I like Disney World better as it offers more options and different parks. We tried to go to California adventure park but many of those rides that you wanted to see did not have a fast pass. It was a lot of walking and I wasn   t exactly certain if some of the rides fit my young son. So I am not sure that the park hopper had really any sort of use for us. I found it definitely something we could do in a day and then Move on. We did go to goofy   s kitchen at the hotel and that was good because we were able to do the character dining. We really didn   t get too close to Mickey Mouse or Minnie mouse during the park hours but we were able to see Pluto a few times. ,Disneyland_California

Look out for the free fast path tickets that are available around the parks but not widely advertised. Moving between the two parks was easy. California Screaming and the World of Colour show were the highlights.

Line ups for everything, food, bathroom, water fountains, everything! I guess I just didn't realize there's no maximum to the number of guests allowed in the park at one time. Seriously if there was a fire, the mass panic and stampede would be deadly. All in all, we enjoyed our time but not nearly like the other four times, the rose colored glasses are off. Try the Plaza Inn for the chicken dinner for $13.99, best deal in the park, and there aren't many deals to be had. Also enjoyed the chicken nuggets and fish sticks at the Stage Door Cafe in Frontireland, the turkey legs, the churros, and of course the pinapple floats at the Tiki hut.

If you think you are king and queen of the castle and expect everyone to bow down to your every whim and want everything perfect and don't have the patience for a short queue here and there, don't come here, in fact don't go anywhere like this.This is a fantasy place. A big amusement park with huge crowds and lots to do. Chill out, soak the atmosphere in. Don't plan your day like a day in the army and don't expect to see the whole park including the studios in a day. Be there for a few days atleast and take things at a leisurely pace.Yes, the queues can be long for the popular rides, yes the food is expensive, yes there is a lot of walking and lots of crowds.

Fortunately for us, we got there during lunch and all the rides did not require us to wait long.

There are some different rides here which is nice but it lacks the Disney 'Magic', as the staff at the park can be rude or gruff depending on who you talk to.

We knew in advance that some of the rides would be closed so this wasn't an issue to us and we thoroughly enjoyed the ones that were open in particular Thunder Mountain, which was closed on our last visit. The parades and the lights show on the castle are truly magical and well worth multiple watches.When we visited last Christmas we were disappointed by the lack of characters around both parks however this time they were numerous characters out and about greeting children and adults alike. Particularly nice to see Princess Jasmine out in the park rather than the only princesses being inside the princess pavilion. We were slightly disappointed to find that the princesses appeared to be on a three day cycle with only Ariel, Aurora and Snow White, considering we were in France we expected to see Belle at least once! Our main criticism came from some of the queue lines and how people with priority passes were handled. In particular for one ride we queued for almost an hour to go on once whilst watching one group of people ride 3 times! We appreciated that people with disability passes and priority passes are able to queue separately and for less time but seeing a group of 8 people going on the ride then running round and getting straight back on multiple times doesn't seem particularly fair.

Everyone knew that when you went to Disneyland, you would be treated to an experience that was absolutely bar none   one that no one could compete with. Well, Knotts, Magic Mountain, Universal Studios, your time has come because Disney has let down it's guard and rested on its laurels for too long. I won't post all of my pictures of us being escorted from rides because they broke down. I also don't have access to all the fast passes that were wasted as we stood in line waiting for rides that broke down   we had paid an extra $10 a ticket for that privilege). If any other business had this many faults, flaws and mechanical failures   the public would lose their minds   but Disney continues to allow these breakdowns to occur without any recourse from public opinion. I researched other forums before posting this   amazed that the fans allow it, and even justify it when someone asks if all the breakdowns are the  norm.  Walt, please send your park employees a message from the beyond, mechanical breakdowns would have never been acceptable when you were running the show and at a family trip that costs $1,000s of dollars now, it still should not be a constant occurrence. Sure the park is magical, especially during the holidays, but it's not when the lights come on and you see the inner workings of these rides, trudging up and down Thunder Mountain or in the back of a Fantasyland ride   then, it's just sad.",Disneyland_California

So when we visited Hong Kong on our World Trip at the end of last year, we just had to visit Disney Hong Kong. I had read about it and knew beforehand it was considerably smaller than Disneyland CA. However what we were not prepared for was the lack of people visiting this park which although it made the queues for the rides a joy, being able to just walk up to the attraction and there be only up to 10 people waiting in line or simply non at all, it lacked atmosphere and character. The Asian people are certainly not as demonstrative as the Americans, which all adds to the fun and flavour of the visit and makes it exciting and buzzy. You could see European people coming through the gates and looking around in amazement as we had done, especially if they had been to the US parks. The parades were excellent as with the evening electric light parade which was very high tech. The fireworks at the end of the evening were beautiful too as with all Disney parks. They don't have electric wheel chairs, so I pushed my husband around in a normal wheelchair which certainly burned off the calories! Leaving the park once the fireworks had finished was very easy, there is a train station right by the entrance which we chose not to take as to get back to our hotel we would have had to make several changes, but the option is there, but we took a taxi and there was not one person in line before us. The taxi ride was around 45 minutes back to Happy Valley area in Hong Kong and cost us approx 20 euros either way, so an obvious choice for us. It was worth a visit as its Disney and the cost of a park entrance for us as over 65 years old was the princely price of 11 euros each, the regular cost was minimal. It was disappointing, but still a must visit for us.",Disneyland_HongKong
287868979,5,2015-07-01,United States,This place is the happiest place on earth. Go on a Tuesday or Wednesday for less crowds competitively. The weekends (Friday through Sunday) are super crowded. Stay for the fireworks inside the park to listen to the music and story that goes with. It makes them 100x better! Also FASTPASSes are the key to a happy Disney day! ,Disneyland_California
287273516,5,2015-03-01,United Kingdom,"If you haven't been, its waiting for you!.. leave the kids at home! oh ok if you must take them, don't let them spoil YOUR fun. Whether you are 5 years old, or 50 years old.. (or even older as we have had a Golden Wedding Anniversary there) if you are the type of person who likes to enjoy themselves then this is the place for you. Forget about the clich  s about French people, everybody is friendly and helpful. The place is immaculately clean and if its not.. Tell Mickey!. Its not cheap, but then what theme park is.. the only difference here is that its TWO theme parks (but two days are not nearly enough), evening entertainment and hotels and restaurants all in one. Hotel Cheyenne is the best for families I think.. and Sequoia Lodge best for adults for a reasonable cost. We have been all times of the year.. Paris can be hot in the summertime and lots of queues.. Easter can be cold and windy but less people there. My personal favourite time of the year is either Halloween Fireworks time.. or... CHRISTMAS (from early November onwards) its Magical and not so queued. They do special offers sometimes which gives you an evening meal as well as breakfast.. it will save you lots of money. Go up in the balloon if only just to see how big Disneyland Paris is. IF you can manage to book an extra day on your holiday, and you like shopping.. have a day at the Big Shopping Centre, about 10 mins bus or car journey from the parks, which includes an Outlet Village which includes all of the Designer Outlets that you can think of.. time to forget your wallet, gentlemen. All in all if you are prepared to let yourself go, I guarantee you will want to go back.. maybe more than once. You have to go to the Buffalo Bill show and also the Stunt show in the Studios park. I could go on for hours but you really need to see it for yourself. On his first trip in his typical style..My father in law said on the motorway there as it was raining... 'don't know why they didn't build it in Spain in the sunshine'... after spending the whole 5 days with a smile on his face and Goofy in his cowboy gear sitting on his lap at breakfast he changed his mind as he says it doesn't matter where it is. He has been back now too many time to mention.",Disneyland_Paris
246490574,4,2014-12-01,United Kingdom,"This was our third visit to Disneyland Paris and our first over the christmas period. We arrived on Boxing day for a 3 night, 4 day break staying at the Disney Davy Crockett ranch. The whole place was very christmassy, the decorations, lights, parades and the finale were simply amazing. I think a lot of the reviews on here are ridiculous and too harsh. The reality is it is going to be busy, it is going to be cold and you are going to have to queue as this is a fantastic place. However, with good planning you can get the most out of your time here and if you are staying in a Disney hotel, you have over 14 hours in a day to squeeze in as much as you can (8am   10.20 pm when the show ends). TOP TIP 1: Make good use of the fastpass tickets. There are around 5 rides in each park that let you use a fastpass. The first thing you do when you arrive at the park is get a fastpass for the ride you want to go on most. Send 1 person to collect the fastpasses as you need to scan the entry tickets, whilst the rest of you queue for another ride. The person collecting the tickets can then join you in the other queue. NOTE: you are unable to get another fastpass until the ones you have expire. TOP TIP 2: There are long queues to meet the princesses and characters. For Elsa & Anna, this was around 3 4 hours minimum so get there as early as possible and start queuing. Although the queue does not open until 10 or 11 am, people were queuing from 8am for Elsa & Anna!. TOP TIP 3: I recommend Mickey Caf   in the Disney Village to meet the characters. You can use your half board   full board meal vouchers as part payment if you have them. As a family of 5 it cost us an additonal 50 Euro on top of our meal vouchers and we saw Minnie, Mickey, Pluto, Goofy and Tigger. Each of them signed our books and let us have a photo. Typically a 2 course meal costs around 25 30 euro per person and kids get a drink with that. I would recommend the Auberge in the Disneyland Park to meet the princesses. However, this is a bit more expensive than Mickey Caf   but you can still use your half board   full board meal vouchers as part payment. My daughters got to meet Belle, Cinderella & Prince Charming, Ariel and 2 other minor characters. The princesses spent time talking to my daughters and again each of them signed their books and let us have a photo. The setting was wonderful and Cinderella & Prince Charming did a dance in the middle of the room which was memorable. Me and my son sat this one out due to the cost and we ate in the Plaza Gardens. The food was lovely in the Plaza Gardens (buffet) but only 1 toliet meant a 10 minute wait!. My wife and 2 daughters did the princess lunch. The cost for an adult was 67 euro and for the kids 34 euro each for a 3 course meal. The food was lovely and well presented. The dessert was served in a white chocolate, Cincerella slipper with a flaming creme brule  . I joined my family at the end of the meal, which the restaurant had no issue with. The total cost for 3 with drinks was around 145 euro and it ended up costing me 90 euro on top of the meal vouchers we used towards it. Given that queues for princesses in the park were averaging around 2 hours, I feel this was good value and a memorable experience (and no queuing in the cold for hours!). NOTE: I recommend booking Mickey Caf     The Auberge well in advance before you leave the UK. You need to call Disneyland Paris restaurant reservations and book a table. This is a free service, no deposit required. We will definitely come again but in the summer. Although it is beautiful at christmas, it is very cold ( 2 degrees on 2 of the days so dress as you would for Ski ing!) but I would still recommend coming at this time of year at least once just to experience the magic. I would say 3 nights, 4 days is just about right to fit most if it in without rushing around like a lunatic!",Disneyland_Paris
328790295,5,2015-11-01,United States,"This was my first time to Disneyland since using a mobility scooter and I was a little worried about how it would go but it turned out wonderfully. They could not be more accommodating or kinder. Some rides are easier than others to use, for example, I would not try Pirates of the Caribbean again since it was very hard for me to get into and out of the boat. For the Haunted Mansion, they stopped the ride so I could get into the car and that made it doable, although I felt bad about others having to wait for me.",Disneyland_California

566364797,3,2018-03-01,United Kingdom,"My hubby, son (nearly 4 yrs old), 2 friends and their two kids (one nearly 4 yrs old and one 1.5 yr old) went to Disneyland Paris for 5 days in March.Disneyland Paris needs a serious lick of paint and modernising. 25 years old and it shows. Some of the rides have not changed at all since we first went nearly 20 years ago. And some of the rides (Dumbo, flying carpet and rockets) are basically the same ride with just different exteriors   come on Disney   get some new, better rides here!!There was certainly the Disney magic in the air and it was amazing to see my son soaking it all up and loving it but myself, hubby and our two friends were really struggling with just how rude some of the  locals  can be   they don't queue (quite frequently pushed in), they look down on you if (god forbid) your child makes a noise or can't stand still when in a long queue for a ride and never apologise if they bump into you (and yet as typical Brits, we would always say sorry even if not our fault). After the 2nd or 3rd day it really started to irritate me.I never felt like we got value for money while we were there   the majority of the shops are filled with the same  tat . What ever happened to all the lovely, collecatbles that Disney used to offer? The main shops are all full with the same soft toys or plastic toys, all made in China. Once you've been in one shop then you've kind of seen it all.If you want the nice stuff you need to look into the smaller boutique shops but be prepared to pay a small fortune. There is, however, a Christmas shop that is now open all year round for baubles etc. Although looking closely at some of the baubles (again, made in China) the paint finish is awful and sooo not worth the money. I didn;t see any that were less than    8 per bauble.We stayed at the Newport Bay Club Hotel which was a short walk to and from the park. Never used the busses.On our first day, upon leaving the park, we walked almost a whole mile in the wrong direction (we thought we were heading to the hotel) before heading back into the park and asking a security guy (who grunted and pointed in a direction) to show us the way to the hotels   the lack of signage or information is shocking and I would expect more from Disney. More signs needed to guide people to the hotels please!!Be prepared to queue queue and queue some more. To be fair, when we went the queues weren't too bad but just be prepared if travelling with small kids   its a lot to expect them to stand and behave in a queue for so long. Last time we went, nearly 20 yrs ago, the characters could be found all round the park and you could just walk up, take your photo and carry on with your day but now there are designated areas for characters and specific times when they'll be there....and long queues! Then you feel rushed to have your pic taken.We also opted for the photo pass but were very disappointed that hardly any of the characters actually had someone from Disney with a camera   so that was a complete waste of money! Our biggest downer of the holiday was Eurostar at Disney end   so unorganised. Chaos does not even cover it! Again, lack of signage and no one there to offer any help or guidance. Be prepared for absolute chaos.All in all, Disney is Disney and it is magical but if they could just update it and sort out the issues at the Eurostar terminal it would make it much better.",Disneyland_Paris
662156115,5,2019-03-01,Australia,Went to HK Disneyland via the MTR ( easy to get there and back) early March. Most days before were light showers but not cold. Our day was no rain :) and it took only 5 minutes to get onto the rides we wanted. Wife had never done a disney trip before and got some good shots with the Characters. She thoroughly enjoyed the Main Street parade and when we left the train was 2 minutes walk which was easy to get to our hotel.,Disneyland_HongKong
200667656,4,2014-04-01,United Kingdom,"After visiting Disneyworld recently we were a little worried we were making a mistake coming here thinking it would be nowhere near as good. We were wrong. Obviously it is not Disneyworld but we still had a great time, some of the rides were better than the same ones in Florida, such as Space Mountain. You have to have your wits about you when queueing as we witnessed queue jumpers five times. No one got past me however but my children were scared not to let them past so I had to act like bouncer! We were very disappointed in the lack of characters, luckily we had booked Cafe Mickey and that was the only place we got photos and autographs.",Disneyland_Paris

145202893,5,,Singapore,"First of all, go only during weekdays. Again, avoid weekend. And to be triple sure, go during weekend, and mainland china holiday season at your own risk.We travelled specifically on a Tuesday, as our neighbor who travelled there during weekend, three weeks before us, had such unfortunate encounters. They waited for 2 hrs for each ride, shoved around and cut q by all other people... Comparatively, our average q time is 2 mins for each station, and the longest one is the character photo taking session at fantasy land, max 15 mins for Mickey mouse. During weekdays, china mainland tourist are rare, as such not so much jumping the q, or rushing in and pushing you out of the front q (not that it doesnt occur, just fewer).IMO Disneyland hong kong did their best, but there is a limit on how they can control the crowd.Back to the fun part: yes both my kids enjoyed the trip totally, highlight of their Hk trip.(aged 3 and 4). I would suggest upon arrival take the train for one stop to fantasy land, cover all scenes there (the little world is nice, also character photo in the park). The self driven car at toy story land is very nice, and the LILO and stitch live q&a session is funny. Parade is grand. I find the lion king performance also a must to enjoy. Ending the park visit with the highlight Of 8pm fireworks.We stayed at Disneyland hotel for that night but IMO ~400usd is a hefty price tag for the hotel. You are better off getting a good hotel nearby and take a cab or mtr after exiting the park.A must visit, especially for kids. Food is pricey but within acceptable range.",Disneyland_HongKong

168022683,5,2013-07-01,Romania,"This was our first visit do Disneyland Paris, wishing to make our kids of 4.7 yrs a nice holiday present. We traveled by car from Germany and lodged at ResidHome Apparthotels (see my review of this hotel). As the hotel was practically on the doorstep of the RER station Val d'Europe, we used this transportation means to get to Disney.We chose to visit during the week   i.e. Monday and Tuesday   and we probably were right, as there were queues, but not very long (we've never spent more than 20 min in a queue). We only tried the rides for smaller children, which means we spent almost the whole time in Fantasyland and Adventureland. We spent a whole day in the park, with a short afternoon nap break in the hotel, until around 10 p.m. when the kids were too tired to go on, so we missed the Disney Dreams show at 11.00, but there is always a next time!Pluses: clean, great rides, short queues, lots of alternatives. The parade at 7 p.m. was great indeed and the kids enjoyed the moment.Minuses: poor organisation for Mickey Mouse house (that was one we missed due to the poorly organised queue) and princess reservation (we couldn't get fast passes for the hour we wanted, so, after staying 20 min in a queue all I got was a reservation for 3 p.m. when my kids had to sleep...); not enough fast passes for all rides; poor and expensive food and drinks; the toys and princess dresses in the shops are highly overpriced, beware!; was very disappointed as virtually no Disney characters were walking through the park during the day. We caught a glimpse of Rabbit from Winnie the Pooh, but it was even more disappointing! Also, another disappointment was that not all Disney movies are featured in the park (kids asked about the Aristocats, Dalmatians, Jungle Book, Lion King and had no clue what to answer them).Favourite ride: Peter Pan Flight and A Small World (the latter not to miss!!!). The Dragon's cave (right before the entrance of the Castle) is also good, but many people miss it because of its position, as it is not very well marked.As for Adventureland, it is great indeed (Robinson's Cabin is amazing, and so is the Pirate adventure). We spent time in the Pirate playground, which is very well equipped. Next time we will definitely get 1 day 2 parks tickets, so we can combine the 2 parks at least one day. Or maybe even a Passport, which is worth it if you go at least two times a year.For kids under 6 yrs old, strollers are a must (there are also to rent in the park), I saw even older kids 9 10 yrs in strollers, as it is very tiring for their little feet.All in all, a great experience, but would really like to try the  real  Disneylands in the US.",Disneyland_Paris
190463167,5,2013-11-01,Australia,"Disneyland, need I say more? It's called the  Happiest Place on Earth  for a reason and it did not disappoint. I'm not a kid anymore and my mum and I thoroughly enjoyed our day here. We were there on opening at 10am and left after the fireworks display finished close to 8pm.We went on almost every ride and I think the longest time we waited in line was 30 minutes. This was on a Tuesday, so can you imagine on weekends? We recommend grabbing a map and make your way around that way. My favourites were the Haunted Mansion and It's a Small World.We brought in our own lunch but dinner wise, there weren't many choices around the Autopia ride.We pre purchased our tickets online and it was simple and fast. At USD$92 adult though, I thought it was a bit pricey. But hey, it'll be a while before I take my own kids there.The parade (5:30pm) and fireworks (7:30pm) display with 'snow' at the end was very nice, though it does get crowded and the staff fence off areas. So, it'd be better to grab a spot early. Mind you, we were there mid November.Overall, a great day out for everyone of all ages!",Disneyland_California

286459607,4,2015-06-01,Sweden,"A fun place to add your life's experience!I am deaf so I went to information place to get a card so me and my companion could skip the queues. I am writing my review based on that. I am sure I would not have enjoyed the place as much if we had to go the queues in the heat.The service is great, very service minded people. Fantastic on that aspect!!I love the rides, the fantastic themeing! Some of the rides are quite rough, however. The Aerosmith rollercoaster was too rough for me, I got headache from that one. I do not mind super thrill rides that give me lots of thrill in my belly but this was just shaking around. But the other coasters were good to great. Get ready for quite dark rides, many of them are inside building in very dark setting. so if you are afraid of darkness or want to talk with each other (I am deaf, remember) it might not be good. But if you do not mind being silent for a while just waiting in darkness.... no problems. :)Despite the  no queue  we had we did not have time to visit the Fantasy area (if it is called so? The area with classic Disney themeing and mascots) it was closed quite early and we had to walk back as directed by a lady. Then we undrestood why, it was time to wait for the castle show! Amazing! it took 25 minutes, the whole show!! Light show with movie parts shown on the castle itself, mixed with some effects such as fireworks and fire. Food wasn't so good here. Bad variety of food, lack of nice icecream. Water super expensive. So maybe good idea to bring your own? Souvenirs and toys also super expensive. But that's kind of understandable. I just pity the families with lots of kids wanting their own diadem above 15    each, then toys, then outfits.... Ouch!! I wanted a diadem with mouse ears but decided not to buy. I did buy a small glass to my sister who loves Ariel and a fridge magnet. ;)So in short: great experience with lots of amazing themeing. But expensive, expensive.Forgot to say, great place if you have some kind of disability. Both for the no queue card and for the flat surface, without hills   good for wheelchairs.",Disneyland_Paris

A dream come true for her. Be sure to stop by city hall if you are celebrating something special. A cast member gave my daughter an Honorary Citizen button because she was so patient waiting.

195752208,3,2014-02-01,United Kingdom,"First of all, I must say that when we visited it was cold and drizzling, so that might affect the review a little. We took the special Disney themed MTR ( Magical Train Ride ? They really should have taken advantage of this acronym) to the park. We arrived at the Western styled train station which was, of course, very Disney, but also gave us the impression of a slightly  cheap knock off  effect...Ticket for entry was HK$450 for an adult, which is very similar to a ticket price for Alton Towers in the UK, but in terms for bang for your buck, this place was lacking. Disney is still very popular in Hong Kong and China, so obviously a theme park here would do great business, but having been to theme parks before, my wife and I had certain expectations. My wife especially so, since she has been to the Disneyland in Florida. The trademarked Disney castle was shamefully small. The rides were not incredibly thrilling. That is not to say they weren't fun, but their warning to tell riders to remove their glasses for Space Mountain, were very overcautious. I just ended up feeling quite sick for not having my glasses on as I could not see the ride. The best rides were the Runaway Mine Cars and Mystic Manor, but since there are only 6 or so rides there, there aren't many to choose from. We managed to spend 4 hours in the theme park, but we left with a mostly dissatisfied view of the place. The place obviously had to cater more to the locals and so, the place concentrated on shows, souvenir shops, and eateries, which were not our thing. At least, I can say, we have visited it now, but I think if you want a true Disney experience, then this is not the Disneyland to visit.",Disneyland_HongKong

555975200,3,2018-01-01,United States,"Missed the old style or type of service Disneyland used to give . Yes I can help you get to next ride or store no problem.Employees in store we went in were outstanding in there help nice touch.To many of the employees on rides were just talking to each seems over staff on to many ,other like they didn   t have tIme to help us to get to next area as some things have changed since we were there last . Our kids even picked up on this and told us about how they felt about it. Like they didn   t have time for you they just wanted to talk to each other rude staff members.So help or lack of it made that what was new and or where we could get our handicap person on this ride or not uncomfortable to say the least.To many employees together seemed to just stand around togetherness and talked,we did find a few employees at it   s a small world to help and goofy kitchen staff was a great help to us.We missed the nights fireworks as we didn   t know about the time it was taking place and we were coming back from dinner at goofys kitchen wonderful staff clean comfortable as I said and saw the very end,we would have gone back sooner if we had got the right answer to what time fireworks display was going to happen. We talked as family oh well we saw little of the end from the tram ride back so better then not at all.we tried to make the best of all and have wonderful vacation on earth.Ice cream pineapple treats was great while waiting to get In to see singing birds a must to try and we all loved it worth it oh yes indeed. Enjoy the jungle ride ,submarine,cars ,toon town, pirates of the Caribbean , riverboat ride,shops, once you got into parking garage it was spacious clean comfortable to get into next area to get bags check out and then on a ride over to park all came together. Long lines to get in to park but that   s nothing new .We all talked on way home and we will go back but we are going to have to have better service and help on our visit.Maybe it   s not this bad all the time.We went away with will give it another try before we say no way Universal and warner brothers is so much more fun.Kids and adults love the fun had at other two places in the past.",Disneyland_California
174318223,4,2013-08-01,United Kingdom,"I have just written a review of the Disneyland Paris Studios which seems to be where all the money is going at the moment from a development point of view. Having not visited Disneyland for 6 years and now visiting with teenage children we were hoping the magic had remained in tact. To be fair it has and I don't have a bad word to say about this place as its brilliant! Anyone visiting for the first time would not notice the cut backs on shows and parades since the last time we visited. Sadly missing this year was the night time illuminated parade which always came before the fireworks, replaced with a rather spectacular effects show projected on to the castle which appealed to our older children but might have been lost on some of the younger ones. Also very obvious in its absence was the extraordinary Tarzan show which was a shame and nothing replaced it from what we could see. Likewise with the Lion King show which used to happen daily in Videopolis and was replaced this year by touring brass bands, not quite the same when you are having your pizza lunch. On the subject of food, its expensive but serves the purpose. You should enter a place like Disney with no thoughts of budget, I read someone else wrote 'leave the budget at home', I completely agree!All that said the rides are as amazing as ever, the 20th Year Parade was excellent and we all had an amazing time! My one tip if you are staying in one of the Disney hotels would be get the breakfast in the Park offer! To get it make sure you check in early as there are a limited number available and ask for it during check in. So happy 20th Disneyland Paris and hope to see you again real soon...",Disneyland_Paris

Can certainly fit everything into a day.We used Fast Pass for a few rides & it worked well.We ate at Cafe New Orleans   very good meal.Only disappointment was this...and IT'S A BIG ONE.We only saw 2 characters ALL DAY. Pluto was around but only available for a short time   both times that we saw him.When we compared this to Orlando...very different.,Disneyland_California
410689313,5,2016-08-01,United States,"I love this park!!! It is very similar to Orlando's Disney World, but has a few different rides (oldies, but goodies) such as the Matterhorn, Mr. Toad's Wild Ride, the submarines (Nemo themed), and Storybook Land. The castle belongs to Sleeping Beauty and is much, much smaller than Cinderella's castle. Pirates of the Caribbean has a restaurant inside it (Blue Bayou) which I would recommend to anyone. This park does get really crowded at night, but the fireworks show and the evening parade are both  must sees.  Teacups is an outdoor attraction (no overhead cover) but is in a great location. The Indiana Jones ride is absolutely awesome and I would recommend it to anyone.",Disneyland_California

Liked all the rides and parades but hated the pushing and shoving and queuing up for about 60 minutes in order to have a 3 minutes train ride.. In order to see it all you need 2 3 days, avoid the weekend when the park is packed with visitors and you can't even walk..The kids loved it! Hadn't seen something like that before... Tip!

Disneyland Park in Paris, for example, is one of the most beautiful parks you'll see. Many people judge Paris and compare it to the much larger Disney parks in America, which is very unfair. Disneyland Park has many different qualities. As expected, it has a big European charm about it. The park follows the same layout as all other Disney parks, different lands surrounding the castle in the middle. There's so much to do here. Trust me, this place isn't just for children.

However it is now starting to look tired with some of the attractions looking a little dishevelled and unkempt. Some of the rides closed early for some reason and the runaway train was closed x 3 times due to a fault which really disappointed our little girl. The Pirates of the Caribbean ride is a must as always but this had been changed too so somewhat lost its surprise element as the galleon had been moved. Food was expensive and the staff were a little rude. The best part of the trip was the hotel (not on the park   I will add) but it was approx. a 5 min bus shuttle ride away   the Radisson Blu Hotel was great. The food and facilities were great as was the Spa!. It was approx.   140 a night for a family night whereas a stay at the park would have cost us approx.   400   shocking as it was only the Davey Crocket lodge which is a static caravan! After Eurodisney we went to Paris which is a real must! Visited the Champs Elysees, Arc de Triomphe, the Eifel Tower and Notre Dame   absolutely amazing trip but may miss Eurodisney next time!",Disneyland_Paris

All bags and suitcases are scanned for security issues..which was good.. The Disneyland park was on their 25th anniversary and had a great sparkle display sign near the main entrance..The main street USA was great But the sleeping beauty castle was beautiful ..You can walk into the castle ,go upstairs to the stained glass windows which are stunning..then go downstairs to see the dragon in the cave..The rides get very busy around lunch time so try and go early morning or late evening for your favourite rides..and get fast pass tickets,machines near the rides..We enjoyed all the rides especially buzz lightyear laser blast..and a chance to sit down..as we walked for hours and hours..were flat shoes ! The drinks and snacks are expensive..There is lots of toilets nearby..Remember to take suncream as it gets very hot in summer months..Please remember this park is opened all year round and at some point attractions and rides are closed for maintenance and refurbishment so check which ones are closed before hand so your not too disappointed when you get there too much..we were sad to miss pirates if the Caribbean..The french staff were nice and friendly..Nearly forgot the Disney illuminations fireworks were fantastic..but started at 11pm.The Disney stars on parade was very good..and the new happy anniversary show on stage at the castle was great..magical ",Disneyland_Paris

247572034,3,2014-07-01,Canada,"We are Disney fanatics. One of the big reasons for going to Paris was to see DLP! And we were, I am sad to say, disappointed. Although there are some very cool rides, and the Disneyland Park itself is very pretty, it lacks the magic of the US parks. Staff are not at all friendly (such a stereotype, but it is true), the Studios park is quite ugly and poorly themed, and crowd control is zero. There are several rides that are certainly worth going to  and really, they DO make the trip worthwhile, just be prepared for an experience where guests are viewed as some sort of irritating nuisance. NO ONE will tell you to have a magical day here. We had seasons passes  and I had to FIGHT to get them because I kept my maiden name, my husband hadn't joined us, and the staff refused to believe that my children were mine. It was a nightmare experience.GREAT RIDES AT STUDIOS: Ratatouille is well worth it! IT is a very innovative dark ride. We ate at the restaurant and it was very poor, and we waited for two hours beyond our reservation... but the d  cor is very very well done. The ride makes you feel that you actually are a tiny mouse in a French kitchen! The queue is breathtaking... you wait on the rooftops of Paris. I would return to Disneyland just for this queue.CRUSHES COASTER: the lines are terrible, even at rope drop expect to wait up to an hour. but.. the ride is astonishing! It blends a dark ride with an indoor coaster and my kids couldn't get enough. Rude ride operators questioned my daughter if she was 7 every time we rode, but other than that we loved this ride. Even the queue is cool, you wait on a pier in Sydney. It perfectly simulates the experience of riding the current with the turtles from Finding Nemo.TOWER OF TERROR: my kids hated the one in Orlando... this is an abbreviated version, and just right for my kids... it has the drop thrill but less of the ghost story.ATTRACTIONS WORTH SEEING AT DISNEYLAND PARK:Big Thunder Mountain Railroad: this is the longest version of this ride at any Disney park... and you can tell! three lift hills of awesome family fun! We rode this 50 times last summer. Pirates of the Caribbean: this blends the gorgeous queue of the Orlando park with the long ride of the California park... and it includes a few big surprises! Our favorite version of this ride.Disney Dreams: the nighttime show is great... but we waited 2 hours to see it and still didn't have the best seats. Disney needs to improve viewing for this show and perhaps introduce a fastpass for a viewing area. It was not fun to wait 2 hours... one night we showed up a mere 90 minutes early and there was no hope that we would get a spot to sit to see the show.Walk Throughs: there are some cool ones here  Jules Verne's submarine, Aladdin, an Alice in Wonderland walk through... neat stuff.It is super easy to get to from Paris  there is one train that goes directly to the entrance, it was never crowded and always air conditioned. I would never stay at this resort  the staff are far too unfriendly, and the access from the city of Paris is just too convenient (you are deposited from the train very few steps from the front gate)",Disneyland_Paris

184324858,3,2013-10-01,United Kingdom,"I have visited Disneyland in Tokyo and that was awe inspiring, magical and definatly worth the money, so much so I actually went twice on two seperate trips. I took my 8 year old to the Paris disneyland to give her the same 'magical' experience I had, however, Paris is woefully lacking in atmosphere. Admittedly it was raining 'cats and dogs' when we went but after making all that effort then we were determined to have a fab time regardless of the weather so that really didn't make any difference. My 8 year old liked the surroundings and found this lovely to look at but being a thrill seeker she wanted to go on all the big rides she could and found it sooo frustrating having to wait for long times to even get on the ride, fast track didn't work for us as we waited and got fast track tickets for space mountain and then the ride broke down making it impossible for us the get any further fast track tickets as those were still active. The food was extortionately priced, and really, is there any need to take further advantage of people when they get inside the resort? The choice was excellent but I dread to think how much anything other than burgers and chips would cost as that's all we had and that cost us 42euro for 3 people. I think because of the rain the parades were cut short which was a shame, and the fireworks were left to very late at night 10.30 ish and we had to be back on our coach by then so missed that display. The place was generally tired and a little run down and some of the workers were not very helpful and clearly didn't want to be out in the rain on a Sunday!!!!!!!!!!!! I wouldn't rush to go back to Disneyland Paris but on the other hand I would go back to take my youngest Grand daughter who is only 10 months at the moment but when she's 8 the park may well of had a facelift!.

258650002,4,2015-03-01,United Kingdom,"Let me first say we are Disney fans. We have visited Paris three times previously over the past 15 years and also squeezed in a visit to Florida. My girls just love the whole Disney atmosphere and after a break of 6 years we returned for a 4 day trip in early March 2015. We travelled by Eurostar, stayed at the Hotel New York and opted for a special DB&B deal which enabled us to eat on a  premium plus  basis in the parks and also enjoy an afternoon treat! It wasnt cheap but vs the published normal price was a relatively economical way of visiting and eating. Overall impressions remain positive. The people working at the park were all without exception very pleasant and as you would expect at Disney. The park was spotless and the shows parades were all first class. Food at all three restaurantswe used was above average with the Hotel New York main restaurant especially good. The rides were great fun and there were two new ones in the Studios park to enjoy since our last trip So why only four stars? Well firstly, the crowd management systems are now quite poor and the queues were far worse than we can ever recall especially on the weekends. Information about relative ride queues was non existent and we witnessed some really nasty queue pushing with little supervision evident. One poor lady was threatened with assult when she protested at being pushed out of her place! The worse aspect was that during our stay virtually all of the key rides (Thunder Mountain  Pirates  Haunted Manor  Ratatouille) broke down at peak times and remained closed for some hours. In addition, Space Mountain remains closed and there are quite large parts of the old park closed for renovation creating extra pressure on those areas open. Safety is of course paramount but the old park in particular feels in dire need of investment   not only in maintenance but also in new rides to complement the traditional offering. The Hotel New York also feels as if it's overdue a facelift.Don't be put off   it's still a great experience but I do feel the magic is in danger of slipping away if Disney don't reinvest some of the parks takings.",Disneyland_Paris

I was not willing to wait that long. I understand that it was necessary to wait, but this seems to take more time out of family fun and you spend more time waiting than enjoying yourself.To my personal displeasure there was no clubhouse in Mickey's Toontown.

A little is lost because of language barrier, but the multiple language availability allows for a lot more people to experience the parks freely, though it does compromise a bit of the camaraderie you tend to enjoy at Disneyland.

We did all the rides once we got there (space mountain, indiana jones, is a small world, jungle ride) t'd then breaked for snack. Had the mickey mouse beignets and mint julep...yum! Then we headed to California Adventure park and then back to Disneyland for some shopping, dinner at Blue Bayou, which was rather pricey, but good food.

536547430,4,2017-10-01,United Kingdom,"We visited Euro Disney with our 7 year old son as part of a big family holiday, staying for 3 nights at the Santa Fe hotel, with the Plus half board option.Each morning breakfast consisted of a basic continental buffet, followed by a pleasant 20 minute walk to the park entrance. The queues to get into the park appeared quite large, but were processed very efficiently. Once inside you initially walk passed rows and rows of shops and food outlets before getting to the attractions.Euro Disney is split into 2 large parks   each takes about 1 day to get around. Both parks are very well landscaped, spotlessly clean and full of friendly, well trained staff. There is a wide range of rides with something for everyone, and our son (1.2m) was allowed to go on everything except Indian Jones rollercoaster. He particularly enjoyed going on the thrill rides that he would be too short for in UK theme parks.Whilst most of the rides can be found in UK theme parks, where Disney excels is in the presentation   the attention to detail takes everything to another level. Average queue time was around 30 40 minutes, average ride time was around 1 minute. Our son has special needs and we obtained a special queue pass for him and 4 companions. On some of the rides (such as Thunder Mountain) the special needs queue was well organised and worked well, whilst on others (such as Tower of Terror) it was badly organised and took longer than the normal queue.There is a wide selection of food available within the park   all extortionately expensive. Restaurant food started at around   25 person and is very good, snack food (i.e. burgers & fries) cost around   10 person and is not that good. Every opportunity is taken to sell merchandise   again at inflated prices.One of the highlights was the closing firework & lightshow at Cinderella's Castle   fantastic display, but would be better if it started earlier (10.00pm). It gets very crowded   get there at least 30 minutes before to find a good spot, try to stand behind some fencing to get some space in front of you.Overall, the best theme park I have ever been to, also the most ruthlessly commercial.

I have to admit I was nervous about spending a small fortune for a 7 hour tour of Disney and California adventure park. But we had only one day in Disney. To say the least, we had a really fantastic day. We spent Christmas eve at Disney with an excellent guide named Chad who efficiently brought us from place to place to maximize our time. He was friendly, knowledgeable, and helped us manage our way through the park efficiently with attention for each family member and the attractions they wanted to see. Chad recommended attractions that we may not have considered in advance that we ended up loving such as California soaring.The vip tour system maximizes use of the fast pass system which is available to everyone. But it sure helps to have an expert make it all easy and efficient. We went on as many rides as we wanted to by the end of the day . This is a true first class VIP experience. It may not to be for everyone's taste or wise budgetary choice. But for a holiday time day, for this family, it was just a perfect, full of plenty of smiles.",Disneyland_California
454184230,5,2017-01-01,India,"One of the best place in Hong Kong to spend a day however if you have been to other Disneyland you might find this one very compact but definitely worth visiting however I come from India and I have not seen other Disney so it was great experience for me and my mother. If you are Asia and have not been to other Disneyland I am sure you will love it.Ticketing: Cost of tickets on Disney Land counter is for HK$589, if you buy it from any 7 11 it would cost you the same, I went to ticketing counter to see if they have got any promotional offer but there was not anything offer, you I installed  KLOOK  application and bought tickets for HK$497.Food: Food inside is dam expensive, half corn HK$100, Piece of Chicken HK$100 and if you are thinking of having meal it will cost you about HK$168 300 depend where and what you eat. I would advise you to buy the food coupon from Main Entrance Ticket Booth which cost HK$238 includes (Lunch   Dinner   Snacks) but there will be long queue so it is best to buy it from    KLOOK    for HK$80 for a decent size meal.Tips: There are many sites where it is stated they do not allow you to carry selfie stick so I did not carry it however its allowed carrying selfie stick everywhere except shows, also they allow you to carry water, biscuits, snacks inside but not meal so it makes sense to carry something specially if you are on a budget. You need to reach for all shows minimum 30 minutes prior to show time to be able to get seat, we ended up missing Mickey show because it was houseful.Park and show timings: Park Hours 10:00 AM to 8:00 PMDisney Paint the Night Parade 6:45 PMAfternoon of Fantasy Parade 3:00 PMFireworks Main Street: 7:45 PMLion King Show: 12:00 PM, 2:00 PM, 4:30 PM, 6:00 PMJedi Training: Trials of the Temple Tomorrow land 11:30 AM, 12:45 PM, 2:00 PM, 3:30 PM, 4:45 PM, 6:00 PM, 7:30 PM (You can skip this one, its more for toddlers) Mickey and the Wondrous Book 11:15 AM, 12:30 PM, 2:00 PM, 4:30 PM, 6:00 PM, 7:15 PM",Disneyland_HongKong

I absolutely loved ever second I spent here and we booked to go back as soon as we got home.The only thing I found frustrating about DLP was people smoking. It has been made an actual thing that you can't actually smoke around the parks, which is great, and they created special places to go if you wanted to smoke. It was nice but then all of a sudden despite the rule, you would walk past and into people smoking and no regard around kids, this really annoyed me, but I'm sure it is very hard to police. Annoys me when people ruin such a nice place.",Disneyland_Paris

265658156,3,2015-01-01,Philippines,"Of course, I was a single guy celebrating my 31st birthday alone when I visited but as a fan of Disneyana and as a writer for children's programming, I thought there was something lacking in terms of the whimsy and magic I've come to expect from Disneyland. This could have also been because many of the buildings   included its centrepiece castle and main street shops   were being renovated at the time but for whichever reason the experience felt cheap and unconvincing. Of course, the rides are still great fun and one area in particular   Mystic Point   would have been incredible had it been much bigger but if you're a completionist who has to choose one full day attraction in Hong Kong, you can easily drop this one.",Disneyland_HongKong
249059654,4,2014-12-01,New Zealand,"I took my 12 (almost 13) year old son to Disneyland (all the way from New Zealand) during the Christmas holidays. If I had the chance to do it again, I would choose a different time.We had a 3 day Hopper pass (29 31 December) which enabled us to visit both Disneyland and California Adventure Park (unlimited entries) on the same day. The problem was that on the first day we had to queue for over an hour at the ticket booth to exchange our voucher for entry tickets. Then once we got our tickets, we were told that Disneyland was FULL and that we were unable to enter the park until after 5.30pm!! However, we could go to California Adventure Park (next door) to fill in the intervening 6 hours. I have to say that it was very disappointing   and unexpected   to fly over 10,000 kms to Disneyland and be told you can't go in.California Adventure Park was also very busy, but manageable. We soon got the hang of using the FastPass system   essential if you don't wan't to spend most of your day standing in a queue. Disneyland was still crowded after 5.30pm and it was difficult to get our bearings in the dark so we didn't stay long.The second day we had a 'Magic Morning' pass (as part of the 3 day Hopper) which meant we (along with quite a few other people) could get into Disneyland at 7am   an hour before it opened to the public. It was definitely worth getting up early and we went on the popular rides like Space Mountain (twice) and Star Tours without having to queue. This was the best part of the whole experience. The park soon filled up and I must say I have never seen so many strollers in one place at one time!The third day   New Year's Eve   we managed to get a FastPass for Radiator Springs at 11am that told us to return at our allocated time slot which was 10 11pm that night   11 hours later! (NB Return time depends on how many passes have already been allocated and FastPasses do run out for the day after a specific number have been allocated.) We did a split day   a few hours at a very crowded Disneyland, back to the hotel for a swim and dinner, and then back for the marvel of being at Disneyland at midnight on New Year's Eve. The fireworks over Sleeping Beauty's Castle were spectacular (even more so than usual) and Main Street was crammed full of thousands and thousands of bodies gazing skyward, so it was certainly a memorable way to see in the New Year.It was magical to see Disneyland all decorated for the holidays (including fake falling snow) and the attractions with a holiday twist (It's A Small World was wonderful with it's Christmas theming) but the crowds and long wait times did manage to dull the magic a little. Go when it's quieter.",Disneyland_California

131483166,5,2012-05-01,United Kingdom,"Disneyland Paris has excellent and outstanding rides, shows and parades and in some respects, is as good as Disney World in Florida, mainly because it is close to Paris. The only downside about the park is that the food and drink is very expensive. It is 3 euros for a bottle of coke, or 30 40 euros each in a buffet restaurant! If you need to get food or drink to take to the parks, I suggest you visit the Val D'Europe complex, which is free by shuttle outside the parks, or one stop on the RER. They have a gigantic hypermarket called  Auchan , which sells snacks drinks significantly less than Disney does. Also, the park is very accessible. You can get here by Eurostar, Autoroute (via Eurotunnel), Train, RER, Shuttle from CDG Airport etc. In conclusion, Disneyland Park is a truly magical place for families and ideal for some couples or disney lovers.",Disneyland_Paris

362480264,4,2016-04-01,United Kingdom,What more can I say my 2 kids 4 and 6 had an amazing time. Weather was great despite the fact it was April. Would have got a 5 but large amount of Park was shut fortunately most of those rides were for bigger kids so we didn't miss out on much. Only other bug was lack of places to get snacks that were actually open. So lack of coffee etc. not great as restaurants would only serve food. We did the dinner with Princesses which was worth the money. Girls had time of their lives.,Disneyland_Paris

204781099,4,2014-05-01,United Kingdom,"We Went to disneyland from Friday 2nd Monday 5th there was 7 of us which included 3 children ages nearly 3, 5 & 7. Overall we had a great time, the shows were fantastic especially the Dreams show at 10pm definitely worth keeping the kids up one night to see it. Also the stunt cars show which the 3 boys loved, the day springtime parade with all the characters were fab. Would definitely recommend booking Buffalo bills Wild West show, we all really enjoyed this, I got tickets off of Ticketnet.fr as they were cheaper and you can print them off yourself. You had food included which we were pleasantly surprised with & adults got free flowing beer & there is lots of crowd participation  yeeha . Obviously eating out in the park is quite expensive but McDonald's seemed pretty reasonable, although most places just seem to do burgers. The downside was the queues for rides, myself & sister in law queued with 3 boys for 1 hour to get on pirates of the Caribbean and when we were nearly at the front it broke down so we had to leave, we also queued for 1hr 15mins for Peter Pan ride which lasted about 2minutes. We didn't manage to get on Crush's ride as queue said 90 mins. Some rides also broke down which was slightly annoying, we used the fast pass as much as possible but these are mainly for the bigger rides. We were disappointed with the tram tour wasn't much of it really apart from 2 dramatic areas but I was expecting abit more. The best rides were Big thunder mountain, pirates of the Caribbean, Small world, space mountain, rock & roller coaster, buzz lightyear, auto mania, toy soldiers parachute drop, Even though we queued a lot we did manage to do most rides in the 3 days & some we did twice.All in all it was a great experience and glad we went although very exhausting with all the walking queuing & long days (10am 10pm) so if you have smaller ones take a buggy. We found the park itself very clean and a lovely setting especially the castle itself which is stunning. However I think it's a one off place now we've done it I don't think we'll be going back for a while.",Disneyland_Paris
558932183,4,2017-07-01,India,"Well   . visiting Disney Land for the first time itself sounds absolutely Thrilling!!It   s kind of more for kids and family entertainment. It was an amazing experience for us though. But for hard core rides & coaster lovers I guess this place won   t work for u guys. However, reaching there wasn   t a task for us as we stayed on Lantau Island itself and the journey from hotel to the park was too short coz our hotel provided shuttle to Disney land which got us there in just 15     20 mins, while people travelling from other places will take more time than usual but its hassle free, MTR which is the second best option I would suggest, because while returning we missed our shuttle, we had to travel through MTR and it was a nice experience.The fountain of Mickey on a giant whale was quite welcoming. Especially kids, you could see the excitement in them watching those Disney characters. There was a live Mickey and Mini interaction when we entered and clicking pics with them which gave a kick start to the day. The rest of the rides were nice and we enjoyed a lot. Also, would suggest to make proper use of maps and the timings mentioned on it for the rides so that you don   t miss any being Sunday the wait time was not more than 15     20 mins.One small disappointment for us was the food coz being an Indian we would prefer Asian or Indian meal but we couldn   t found any options other than European food, especially after those tiring activities anyone would wish to have a meal of their choice. Also, the Indian restaurants that were shown on map were all shut and there was no update regarding the same coz it was far and we had to search walking which was very time consuming.But at the end the very famous Disney Fireworks (09:00 pm) a not to be missed stuff, is a treat to the eyes and it makes you forget the entire day   s tiredness.Over all experience was wonderful and would really suggest to visit once in your life.",Disneyland_HongKong
