# preamble: webscrape queue-times.com for valid park index. By this mode of 
#           preprocessing, we don't have to check for every indices in [1,333].
#           Resultant indices saved as txt file in path 
#           ../data/raw/accepted_indices.txt 
# pre-req: knowledge of BeautifulSoup webscraping library and requests library 
#          for easy handling of lack of API data. Basic understanding of HTML
#          structure for a deployed website and how to access it via 'inspect'.
#
# additional notes: takes 4.5 min (approx) to run this script; the result of 
#                   this script is used in s00_useful_functions.py
#
